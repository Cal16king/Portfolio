            <p>Music is something that I rely on every single day of my life. Its my outlet for Every emotion that is better conveyed through a song than just words themselves. My first instrument that I learned was the upright bass in 4th grade (the large wooden orchestral one). 
            I've picked up quite a few more instruments since then. my range of instruments include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cello</li>
                <li>Electric Bass</li>
                <li>Ukulele</li>
                <li>Kalimba</li>
            </ul>
            
        </div>
