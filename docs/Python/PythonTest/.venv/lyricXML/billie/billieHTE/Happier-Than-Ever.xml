<l>When I'm away from you</l>
<l>I'm happier than ever</l>
<l>Wish I could explain it better</l>
<l>I wish it wasn't true</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Give me a day or two to think of something clever</l>
<l>To write myself a letter</l>
<l>To tell me what to do, mm-mm</l>
<l>Do you read my interviews?</l>
<l>Or do you skip my avenue?</l>
<l>When you said you were passin' through</l>
<l>Was I even on your way?</l>
<l>I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)</l>
<l>Be cool about what I was tellin' you</l>
<l>You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)</l>
<l>And I'd end up more afraid</l>
<l>Don't say it isn't fair</l>
<l>You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable</l>
<l>So if you really wanna know</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)</l>
<l>I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)</l>
<l>Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)</l>
<l>I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm</l>

<l>You call me again, drunk in your Benz</l>
<l>Drivin' home under the influence</l>
<l>You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath</l>
<l>'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends</l>
<l>I don't relate to you</l>
<l>I don't relate to you, no</l>
<l>'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty</l>
<l>You made me hate this city</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="3">
<l>And I don't talk shit about you on the internet</l>
<l>Never told anyone anything bad</l>
<l>'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything</l>
<l>And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad</l>
<l>So don't waste the time I don't have</l>
<l>And don't try to make me feel bad</l>
<l>I could talk about every time that you showed up on time</l>
<l>But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did</l>
<l>Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I</l>
<l>Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid</l>
</section>
<section type="outro">
<l>You ruined everything good</l>
<l>Always said you were misunderstood</l>
<l>Made all my moments your own</l>
<l>Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)</l>
<l>(Ah)</l>
<l>(Goddamn)</l>
<l>(Ah)</l>
<l>(Fuck you)</l>
<l>(Fuck you)</l>
