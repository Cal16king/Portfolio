<l>Everybody dies, surprise, surprise</l>
<l>We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try</l>
<l>To make it feel like we might be right</l>
<l>We might not be alone</l>
<l>Be alone</l>

<l>"Everybody dies," that's what they say</l>
<l>And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way</l>
<l>I just wonder why you'd wanna stay</l>
<l>If everybody goes</l>
<l>You'd still be alone</l>

<l>I don't wanna cry, some days I do</l>
<l>But not about you</l>
<l>It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to</l>
<l>The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while</l>
<l>I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child</l>
<l>It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why</l>
<l>Everybody dies</l>
<l>And when will I?</l>

<l>You oughta know</l>
<l>That even when it's time, you might not wanna go</l>
<l>But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold</l>
<l>But you are not alone</l>
<l>You are not unknownYou might also like</l>
