<l>I don't really even know how it happened</l>
<l>I started talkin', they started laughin'</l>
<l>I don't really even know how it happened</l>
<l>I started watchin' them photographin'</l>
<l>I don't really (I don't really), how it happened</l>
<l>Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)</l>
<l>I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction</l>
<l>No reaction</l>

<l>And everybody said it was a letdown</l>
