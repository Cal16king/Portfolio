<l>Home alone, tryin' not to eat</l>
<l>Distract myself with pornography</l>
<l>I hate the way she looks at me</l>
<l>I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be</l>
<l>That satisfied, it's a male fantasy</l>
<l>I'm goin' back to therapy</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause I loved you then and I love you now</l>
<l>And I don't know how</l>
<l>Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around</l>
<l>If I'm getting over you</l>
<l>Or just pretending to</l>
<l>Be alright, convince myself I hate you</l>

<l>(You want me to put it here?)</l>
<l>(Okay)</l>

<l>I got a call from a girl I used to know</l>
<l>We were inseparablе years ago</l>
<l>Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so</l>
<l>And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel</l>
<l>I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel</l>
<l>But nothing lasts, I know the deal</l>
