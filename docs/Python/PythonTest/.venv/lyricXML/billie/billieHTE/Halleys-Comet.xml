<l>I don't want it</l>
<l>And I don't want to want you</l>
<l>But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest</l>
<l>And I must admit you've been in quite a few</l>

<l>Halley's Comet</l>
<l>Comes around more than I do</l>
<l>But you're all it takes for me to break a promise</l>
<l>Silly me to fall in love with you</l>

<l>I haven't slept since Sunday</l>
<l>Midnight for me is 3 AM for you</l>
<l>But my sleepless nights are better</l>
<l>With you than nights could ever be alone, ooh-ooh</l>
<l>I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless</l>
<l>What a drag to love you like I do</l>
<l>Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh</l>

<section type="verse" n="4">
<l>I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment</l>
<l>I feel more and more like I was madе for you</l>
<l>For you</l>

<l>I'm sitting in my brother's room</l>
<l>Haven't slept in a week or two, or two</l>
<l>I think I might havе fallen in love</l>
<l>What am I to do?</l>
