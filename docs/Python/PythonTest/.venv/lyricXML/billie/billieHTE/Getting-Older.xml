<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well</l>
<l>I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself</l>
<l>There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for</l>
<l>But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door</l>
<l>Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more</l>
<l>Than anyone before (Anyone before)</l>
<l>Too bad they're usually deranged</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Last week, I realized I crave pity</l>
<l>When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse</l>
<l>Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing</l>
<l>And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed</l>
<l>Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest</l>
<l>I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)</l>
<l>Now we're estranged</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Things I once enjoyed</l>
<l>Just keep me employed now</l>
<l>Things I'm longing for</l>
<l>Someday, I'll be bored of</l>
<l>It's so weird</l>
<l>That we care so much until we don't</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="3">
<l>I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders</l>
<l>But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong</l>
<l>I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor</l>
<l>To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure</l>
<l>'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise</l>
<l>Would depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)</l>
<l>(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Things I once enjoyed</l>
<l>Just keep me employed now, mmm</l>
<l>Things I'm longing for, mmm</l>
<l>Someday, I'll be bored of</l>
<l>It's so weird</l>
<l>That we care so much until we don't</l>
</section>
<section type="outro">
<l>But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing</l>
<l>For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine</l>
<l>I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna</l>
<l>Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time</l>
