<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)</l>
<l>Had to save my money for security</l>
<l>Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street</l>
<l>Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet</l>
<l>I bought a secret house when I was seventeen (Ha)</l>
<l>Haven't had a party since I got the keys</l>
<l>Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay</l>
<l>On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm</l>
<l>Yeah, I made him sign an NDA</l>
<l>Once was good enough</l>
<l>'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no</l>
<l>I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Mm, mm-mm, mm</l>
<l>30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)</l>
<l>I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (I think I hate it here)</l>
<l>Maybе I should think about a new career (Uh)</l>
<l>Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear</l>
<l>I've been havin' fun gettin' older now</l>
<l>Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth (Shut his mouth, yeah)</l>
<l>At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about</l>
<l>I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh</l>
<l>Want it now, mm-mm-mm</l>
<l>You can't give me up</l>

<section type="outro">
<l>Did I take it too far?</l>
<l>Now I know what you are</l>
<l>You hit me so hard</l>
<l>I saw stars</l>
<l>Think I took it too far</l>
<l>When I sold you my heart</l>
<l>How'd it get so dark?</l>
<l>I saw stars</l>
<l>Stars</l>
