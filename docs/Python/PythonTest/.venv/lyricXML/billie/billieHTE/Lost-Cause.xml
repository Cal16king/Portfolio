<l>Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)</l>
<l>Like I don't really care right now</l>
<l>But maybe that's fine</l>
<l>You weren't even there that day</l>
<l>I was waitin' on you (You, you)</l>
<l>I wonder if you were aware that day</l>
<l>Was the last straw for me and I knew</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>I sent you flowers</l>
<l>Did you even care?</l>
<l>You ran the shower</l>

<l>Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong (Wrong)</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)</l>
<l>And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was (Was, was)</l>

<l>But you got no job (Job)</l>
<l>You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause)</l>

<l>I used to think you were shy (Shy)</l>
<l>But maybe you just had nothing on your mind</l>
<l>Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time</l>
<l>I used to wish you were mine (Mine)</l>
<l>But that was way before I realized</l>
<l>Someone like you would always be so easy to find</l>
<l>(So) So easy (So, so)</l>

<l>You'd be gone for hours</l>

<l>Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah</l>
<l>Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong (Wrong)</l>
