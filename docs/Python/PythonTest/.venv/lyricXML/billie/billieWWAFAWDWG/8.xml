<l>Wait a minute, let me finish</l>
<l>I know you don't care</l>
<l>But can you listen?</l>
<l>I came committed, guess I overdid it</l>
<l>Wore my heart out on a chain</l>
<l>Around my neck, but now it's missin', hmm</l>

<l>So I think I better go</l>
<l>I never really know how to please you</l>
<l>You're lookin' at me like I'm see-through</l>
<l>I guess I'm gonna go</l>
<l>I just never know how you feel</l>
<l>Do you even feel anything?</l>

<l>You said, "Don't treat me badly"</l>
<l>But you said it so sadly</l>
<l>So I did the best I could</l>
<l>Not thinkin' you would have left me gladly</l>
<l>I know you're not sorry</l>
<l>Why should you be?</l>
<l>'Cause who am I to be in love</l>
<l>When your love never is for me?</l>
<l>Me</l>
