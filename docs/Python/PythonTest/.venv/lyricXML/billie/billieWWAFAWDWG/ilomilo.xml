<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Told you not to worry</l>
<l>But maybe that's a lie</l>
<l>Honey, what's your hurry?</l>
<l>Won't you stay inside?</l>
<l>Remember not to get too close to stars</l>
<l>They're never gonna give you love like ours</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Where did you go?</l>
<l>I should know, but it's cold</l>
<l>And I don't wanna be lonely</l>
<l>So show me the way home</l>
<l>I can't lose another life</l>

<l>Hurry, I'm worried</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>The world's a little blurry</l>
<l>Or maybe it's my eyes</l>
<l>The friends I've had to bury</l>
<l>They keep me up at night</l>
<l>Said I couldn't love someone</l>
<l>'Cause I might break</l>
<l>If you're gonna die, not by mistake</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>So, where did you go?</l>
<l>I should know, but it's cold</l>
<l>And I don't wanna be lonely</l>
<l>So tell me you'll come home</l>
<l>Even if it's just a lie</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>I tried not to upset you</l>
<l>Let you rescue me the day I met you</l>
<l>I just wanted to protect you</l>
<l>But now I'll never get to</l>

<section type="outro">
<l>Where did you go?</l>
<l>I should know, but it's cold</l>
<l>And I don't wanna be lonely</l>
<l>Was hoping you'd come home</l>
<l>I don't care if it's a lie</l>
