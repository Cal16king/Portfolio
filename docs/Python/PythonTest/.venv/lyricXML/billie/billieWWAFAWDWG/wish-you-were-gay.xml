<l>"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood</l>
<l>"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say (Aww)</l>
<l>I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long</l>
<l>If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away (Hahahahahahahaha)</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I just wanna make you feel okay</l>
<l>But all you do is look the other way</l>
<l>I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay</l>
<l>I just kinda wish you were gay</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Is there a reason we're not through?</l>
<l>Is there a 12 step just for you?</l>
<l>Our conversation's all in blue</l>
<l>11 "heys" (Hey, hey, hey, hey)</l>
<l>Ten fingers tearin' out my hair</l>
<l>Nine times you never made it there</l>
<l>I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away</l>
<l>(Yay)</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>How am I supposed to make you feel okay</l>
<l>When all you do is walk the other way?</l>
<l>I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay</l>
<l>I just kinda wish you were gay</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>To spare my pride</l>
<l>To give your lack of interest an explanation</l>
<l>Don't say I'm not your type</l>
<l>Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation</l>
<l>I'm so selfish</l>
<l>But you make me feel helpless, yeah</l>
<l>And I can't stand another day</l>
<l>Stand another day</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I just wanna make you feel okay</l>
<l>But all you do is look the other way, hmm</l>
<l>I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay</l>
<l>I just kinda wish you were gay</l>
<l>I just kinda wish you were gay</l>
<l>I just kinda wish you were gay</l>
