<l>What is it about them?</l>
<l>I must be missing something</l>
<l>They just keep doing nothing</l>
<l>Too intoxicated to be scared</l>
<l>Better off without them</l>
<l>They're nothing but unstable</l>
<l>Bring ashtrays to the table</l>
<l>And that's about the only thing they share</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I'm in their secondhand smoke</l>
<l>Still just drinking canned Coke</l>
<l>I don't need a Xanny to feel better</l>
<l>On designated drives home</l>
<l>Only one who's not stoned</l>
<l>Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever</l>

<l>Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god</l>
<l>(And it's like, wait, like, when?)</l>

<l>Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)</l>
<l>They're late to every party (Ooh)</l>
<l>Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)</l>
<l>Too inebriated now to dance</l>
<l>Morning as they come down (Come down)</l>
<l>Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)</l>
<l>They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)</l>
<l>Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance</l>

<l>Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk</l>
<l>On your cigarette break</l>
