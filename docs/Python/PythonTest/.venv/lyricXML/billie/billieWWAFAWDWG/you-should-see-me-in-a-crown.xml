<l>Bite my tongue, bide my time</l>
<l>Wearing a warning sign</l>
<l>Wait 'til the world is mine</l>
<l>Visions I vandalize</l>
<l>Cold in my kingdom size</l>
<l>Fell for these ocean eyes</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>You should see me in a crown</l>
<l>I'm gonna run this nothing town</l>
<l>Watch me make 'em bow</l>
<l>One by one by one</l>
<l>One by one by</l>
<l>You should see me in a crown</l>
<l>Your silence is my favorite sound</l>
<l>Watch me make 'em bow</l>
<l>One by one by one</l>
<l>One by one by one</l>

<l>Count my cards, watch them fall</l>
<l>Blood on a marble wall</l>
<l>I like the way they all scream</l>
<l>Tell me which one is worse</l>
<l>Living or dying first</l>
<l>Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)</l>

<l>You say, "Come over, baby</l>
<l>I think you're pretty"</l>
