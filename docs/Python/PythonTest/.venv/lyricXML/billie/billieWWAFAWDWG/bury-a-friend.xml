<l>What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?</l>
<l>What are you wondering? What do you know?</l>
<l>Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?</l>
<l>When we all fall asleep, where do we go?</l>

<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Come here</l>
<l>Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly</l>
<l>You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?</l>
<l>Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly</l>
<l>The way I'm drinkin' you down</l>
<l>Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me</l>
</section>
<section type="refrain">
<l>Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)</l>
<l>Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)</l>
<l>Cannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)</l>
<l>Bury a friend, I wanna end me</l>

<l>Listen</l>
<l>Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?</l>
<l>Me to make you my art and make you a star</l>
<l>And get you connected?</l>
<l>I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected</l>
<l>But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart</l>
<l>'Cause I'm too expensive</l>
<l>It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud</l>
<l>Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)</l>
<l>Calling security, keepin' my head held down</l>
<l>Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul</l>
<l>'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no</l>
<l>Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close</l>
<l>And I can't say no, I can't say no</l>
<l>Careful</l>
