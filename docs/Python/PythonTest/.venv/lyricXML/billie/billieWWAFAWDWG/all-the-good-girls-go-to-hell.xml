<l>My Lucifer is lonely</l>

<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Standing there, killing time</l>
<l>Can't commit to anything but a crime</l>
<l>Peter's on vacation, an open invitation</l>
<l>Animals, evidence</l>
<l>Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence</l>
<l>Once you get inside 'em</l>
<l>Got friends but can't invite them</l>

<l>Hills burn in California</l>
<l>My turn to ignore ya</l>
<l>Don't say I didn't warn ya</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>All the good girls go to Hell</l>
<l>'Cause even God herself has enemies</l>
<l>And once the water starts to rise</l>
<l>And Heaven's out of sight</l>
<l>She'll want the Devil on her team</l>

<l>Look at you needing me</l>
<l>You know I'm not your friend without some greenery</l>
<l>Walk in wearin' fetters</l>
<l>Peter should know better</l>
<l>Your cover up is caving in</l>
<l>Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?</l>
<l>Poisoning themselves now</l>
<l>Begging for our help, wow</l>
