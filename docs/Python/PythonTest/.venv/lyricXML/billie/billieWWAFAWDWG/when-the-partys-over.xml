<l>Don't you know I'm no good for you?</l>
<l>I've learned to lose you, can't afford to</l>
<l>Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'</l>
<l>But nothin' ever stops you leavin'</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own</l>
<l>I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that</l>
<l>I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that</l>

<l>Don't you know too much already?</l>
<l>I'll only hurt you if you let me</l>
<l>Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call me back)</l>
<l>And I'll call you when the party's over</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own</l>
<l>And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that</l>
<l>Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that</l>

<l>But nothin' is better sometimes</l>
<l>Once we've both said our goodbyes</l>
<l>Let's just let it go</l>
<l>Let me let you go</l>
