<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>White shirt now red, my bloody nose</l>
<l>Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes</l>
<l>Creepin' around like no one knows</l>
<l>Think you're so criminal</l>
<l>Bruises on both my knees for you</l>
<l>Don't say thank you or please</l>
<l>I do what I want when I'm wanting to</l>
<l>My soul? So cynical</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>So you're a tough guy</l>
<l>Like it really rough guy</l>
<l>Just can't get enough guy</l>
<l>Chest always so puffed guy</l>
<l>I'm that bad type</l>
<l>Make your mama sad type</l>
<l>Make your girlfriend mad tight</l>
<l>Might seduce your dad type</l>
<l>I'm the bad guy</l>
<l>Duh</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I like it when you take control</l>
<l>Even if you know that you don't</l>
<l>Own me, I'll let you play the role</l>
<l>I'll be your animal</l>
<l>My mommy likes to sing along with me</l>
<l>But she won't sing this song</l>
<l>If she reads all the lyrics</l>
<l>She'll pity the men I know</l>

<l>I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone</l>
<l>You said she's scared of me?</l>

<l>But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne</l>
