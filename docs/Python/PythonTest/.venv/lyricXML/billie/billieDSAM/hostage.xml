<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I wanna be alone</l>
<l>Alone with you, does that make sense?</l>
<l>I wanna steal your soul</l>
<l>And hide you in my treasure chest</l>
<l>I don't know what to do</l>
<l>To do with your kiss on my neck</l>
<l>I don't know what feels true</l>
<l>But this feels right, so stay a sec</l>
<l>Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And let me crawl inside your veins</l>
<l>I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain</l>
<l>It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted</l>
<l>Just let me hold you</l>
<l>Like a hostage</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Gold on your fingertips</l>
<l>Fingertips against my cheek</l>
<l>Gold leaf across your lips</l>
<l>Kiss me until I can't speak</l>
<l>Gold chain beneath your shirt</l>
<l>The shirt that you let me wear home</l>
<l>Gold's fake and real love hurts</l>
<l>But nothing hurts when I'm alone</l>
<l>When you're with me and we're alone</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>And let me crawl inside your veins</l>
<l>I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain</l>
<l>It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted</l>
<l>Just let me hold you</l>
<l>Hold you</l>
<l>Like a hostage</l>
<l>Like a hostage</l>
