<l>Lips meet teeth and tongue</l>
<l>My heart skips eight beats at once (That's better)</l>
<l>If we were meant to be, we would have been by now</l>
<l>See what you wanna see, all I see is him right now</l>
<l>H-h-him right now</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I'll sit and watch your car burn</l>
<l>With the fire that you started in me</l>
<l>But you never came back to ask it out</l>
<l>Go ahead and watch my heart burn</l>
<l>With the fire that you started in me</l>
<l>But I'll never let you back to put it out</l>
<l>(Thanks)</l>

<l>Your love feels so fake</l>
<l>My demands aren't high to make</l>
<l>If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now (Ah)</l>
<l>Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow them out</l>
<l>(B-b-blow them out)</l>

<l>I still remember that</l>
<l>Heaven sent a present my way</l>
<l>I won't forget your laugh</l>
<l>Packing everything when you leave</l>
<l>You know you coming back</l>
<l>Wanna see me down on my knees</l>
<l>But that was made for a ring</l>
<l>I try to wait for the storm to calm down</l>
<l>But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war</l>
<l>We droned down on each other</l>
<l>Tryin' to even the score</l>
<l>We all been found guilty in the court of aorta</l>

<l>Tryna even the score</l>
<l>Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn</l>
<l>Found guilty in the court of aorta</l>
