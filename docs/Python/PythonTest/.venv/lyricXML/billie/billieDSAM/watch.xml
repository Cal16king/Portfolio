<l>Lips meet teeth and tongue</l>
<l>My heart skips eight beats at once</l>
<l>If we were meant to be, we would have been by now</l>
<l>See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I'll sit and watch your car burn</l>
<l>With the fire that you started in me</l>
<l>But you never came back to ask it out</l>
<l>Go ahead and watch my heart burn</l>
<l>With the fire that you started in me</l>
<l>But I'll never let you back to put it out</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Your love feels so fake</l>
<l>And my demands aren't high to make</l>
<l>If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now</l>
<l>Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out</l>

<l>When you call my name</l>
<l>Do you think I'll come runnin'?</l>
<l>You never did the same</l>
<l>So good at givin' me nothin'</l>
<l>When you close your eyes, do you picture me?</l>
<l>When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?</l>
<l>Now you know</l>
<l>Now I'm free</l>
