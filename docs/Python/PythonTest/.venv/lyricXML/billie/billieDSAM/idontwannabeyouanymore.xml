<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Don't be that way</l>
<l>Fall apart twice a day</l>
<l>I just wish you could feel what you say</l>
<l>Show, never tell</l>
<l>But I know you too well</l>
<l>Got a mood that you wish you could sell</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>If teardrops could be bottled</l>
<l>There'd be swimming pools filled by models</l>
<l>Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"</l>
<l>If "I love you" was a promise</l>
<l>Would you break it, if you're honest?</l>
<l>Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before</l>
<l>I don't wanna be you</l>
<l>Anymore</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Hands getting cold</l>
<l>Losing feeling is getting old</l>
<l>Was I made from a broken mold?</l>
<l>Hurt, I can't shake</l>
<l>We've made every mistake</l>
<l>Only you know the way that I break</l>
