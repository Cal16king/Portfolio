<l>I've been watchin' you for some time</l>
<l>Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes</l>
<l>Burning cities and napalm skies</l>
<l>Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes</l>
<l>Your ocean eyes</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>No fair</l>
<l>You really know how to make me cry</l>
<l>When you give me those ocean eyes</l>
<l>I'm scared</l>
<l>I've never fallen from quite this high</l>
<l>Fallin' into your ocean eyes</l>
<l>Those ocean eyes</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I've been walkin' through a world gone blind</l>
<l>Can't stop thinkin' of your diamond mind</l>
<l>Careful creature made friends with time</l>
<l>He left her lonely with a diamond mind</l>
<l>And those ocean eyes</l>

<l>No fair (No fair)</l>

<l>I've never fallen from quite this high</l>
<l>Fallin' into your ocean eyes</l>
