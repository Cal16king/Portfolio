<l>Remember when you said it, there's no second chance?</l>
<l>Oh, baby, I heard you been hoping you could change the past</l>
<l>You miss the long goodnights, you miss the long goodbyes</l>
<l>You miss the long goodnights (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)</l>
<l>Well, did you ever think that it was hard for me</l>
<l>To walk it off like nothing happened, nonchalantly?</l>
<l>I got you feeling like, I got you feeling right</l>
<l>I got you feeling like (Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup)</l>

<l>So sue me for looking too pretty tonight</l>
<l>Wearing your favorite color under the lights</l>
