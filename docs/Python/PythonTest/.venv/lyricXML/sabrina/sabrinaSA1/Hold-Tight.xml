<l>Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion</l>

<l>I just want that hand hold with the sweat in the middle</l>
<l>Running down to when I feel alone and the feeling gone, you can touch it a little</l>
<l>Hear me underneath the covers coloring your body, reading Braille</l>
<l>Take you to Bahamas, seeping through the sand</l>
<l>Sucking on the silence, now I'm in your ear</l>
<l>Telling you, baby, to listen, I just</l>
<l>Wanna keep you in, wanna keep you in right</l>
<l>Wanna feel your skin, wanna feel it on mine</l>
<l>Maybe I been on the Internet forgetting how to keep it slow</l>
<l>But no, I need it bitty bad bone Bonnie Clyde, come and get it</l>
<l>I don't know, I get it, get it, I get it, oh</l>

<l>Could be in the canyons, probably in a mansion</l>

<l>Always gotta go out (Gotta go out), we don't ever slow down</l>
<l>(Gotta slow down, down)</l>
<l>Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight</l>
<l>Ah (We keep going, we going)</l>
<l>(I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight)</l>
<l>Always gotta go out (Always gotta go out), we don't ever slow down</l>
<l>(Gotta slow down)</l>
<l>Not like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight</l>
