<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Keep it casual, don't have to tippy-toe</l>
<l>Take your cares off, just stay a couple more</l>
<l>You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger</l>
<l>Go and get a little closer</l>
<l>Playing mind games, we don't do that here</l>
<l>So put your bid in before I disappear</l>
<l>You don't have to be, don't have to be a stranger</l>
<l>Come and get a little closer</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Ain't gotta hesitate</l>
<l>Ain't gotta make me wait</l>
<l>Oh, baby, won't you stay?</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Both of my eyes, they've been fixing on you</l>
<l>Wasting your time, should be making that move</l>
<l>Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya</l>
<l>Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa</l>
<l>What's on my mind, I've been thinking maybe</l>
<l>I could be yours by the time that we leave</l>
<l>Come and say hi, I've been dying to meet ya</l>
<l>Don't leave me hanging like the Mona Lisa, oh</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I know your type, what's with the timid behavior?</l>
<l>You let this ooh-la-la-la intimidate ya</l>
<l>Don't you make me, don't you make me leave on my own</l>
<l>I'm already ready, come on</l>
