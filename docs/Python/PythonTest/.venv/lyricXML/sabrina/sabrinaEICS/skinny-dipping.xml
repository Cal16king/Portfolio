<l>It'll be a Wednesday</l>
<l>And I'll be goin' to this coffee shop</l>
<l>Hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name</l>
<l>And I look up from my phone</l>
<l>And think there's no chance it's you, but it is</l>
<l>You'll say, "Hi," I'll say, "Hi, how are you?"</l>
<l>You'll say, "How's your family? How's your sister?"</l>
<l>I'll say, "Shannon's bein' Shannon"</l>
<l>After a minute of nonsensical chatter, you'll say</l>
<l>"Well, this was really nice, maybe we should do this on purpose sometime"</l>
<l>And it'll have been long enough that we won't harp on (Hmm)</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Arguments in your garage</l>
<l>All the ways we sabotaged it (Mmm)</l>
<l>What it was and what it wasn't</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>We've been swimmin' on the edge of a cliff</l>
<l>I'm resistant, but goin' down with the ship</l>
<l>It'd bе so nice, right? Right?</l>
<l>If we could take it all off and just еxist</l>
<l>And skinny dip in water under the bridge</l>

<l>You'll suggest a restaurant we used to go to</l>
<l>And I'll say, "Won't that be too nostalgic?"</l>
<l>And you'll say, "Maybe, but let's do it anyway</l>
<l>We won't sit at our same old table, I promise</l>
<l>And we won't bring up the past, we'll keep it bureaucratic"</l>
<l>And we won't say it, but both of us, we'll be thinkin' about</l>
<l>How different we are from those scared little kids that had those (Hmm)</l>
