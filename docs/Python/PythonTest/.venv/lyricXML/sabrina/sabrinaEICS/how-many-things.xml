<l>You used a fork once</l>
<l>It turns out forks are fuckin' everywhere</l>
<l>There’s no hiding from the thought of us</l>
<l>I got ways to find you anywhere</l>
<l>We sat on the roof once</l>
<l>Conversation took us everywhere</l>
<l>And we talked until the sun came up</l>
<l>I wish we stayed just like we were up there</l>

<l>I consider you, I'm not trying to</l>
<l>It doesn't matter whether not I want to</l>
<l>I can’t help it, it's a habit</l>
<l>Your corner in my mind is well-established</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I, I wonder how many things you think about before you get to me</l>
<l>I wonder how many things you wanna do, you think I'm in-between</l>
<l>I feel myself fallin' further down your priorities</l>
<l>And I still make excuses for you constantly</l>
<l>I wonder how many things you think about</l>
<l>Before, before you get to me</l>

<l>Remember when you left once?</l>
<l>That never made too much sense to me</l>
<l>Well, it hurt you so bad hurting me</l>
<l>You really came to me for sympathy</l>

<l>Oh, I consider you and I'm not trying to</l>
