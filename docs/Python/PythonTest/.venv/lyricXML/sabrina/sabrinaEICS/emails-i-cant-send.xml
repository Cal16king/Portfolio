<l>It's times like these, wish I had a time machine</l>
<l>So I could see what you did October 13th</l>
<l>At 10:15, were you really asleep?</l>
<l>Were you lyin' to me and the family?</l>
<l>There's no "us" in us when I'm lackin' trust</l>
<l>You wanna discuss, ugh, you disgust me</l>
<l>Don't make me cuss you out, why'd you let me down?</l>
<l>Don't say sorry now</l>
<l>And thanks to you, I, I can't love right</l>
<l>I get nice guys and villainize them</l>
<l>Read their texts like they're havin' sex right now</l>
<l>Scared I'll find out that it's true</l>
<l>And if I do, then I blame you</l>
<l>For every worst that I assume</l>
<l>When I'm forty-five, someone calls me their wife</l>
<l>And he fucks our lives in one selfish night</l>
<l>Don't think I'll find forgiveness as fast as mom did</l>
<l>And God, I love you, but you're such a dipshit</l>
<l>Please fuckin' fix this</l>
<l>'Cause you were all I looked up to</l>
<l>Now I can't even look at you</l>

<l>(You too)</l>
<l>I mean, as they say in Chicago</l>
<l>"He had it comin'"</l>
