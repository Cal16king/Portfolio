<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>We were never in the park</l>
<l>Talkin' on a seesaw teetering with our feelings in the dark</l>
<l>Ignoring tornado warnings</l>
<l>He didn't hold me in his arms</l>
<l>We didn't stumble over the pages of our relationship arc</l>
<l>Ignoring tornado warnings</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Don't understand how quickly we get</l>
<l>Right back in our rhythm without missing a step</l>
<l>And logically the last thing I should have on my mind</l>
<l>But I want you there sometimes</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I guess maybe that's why I'm lying to my therapist</l>
<l>I keep saying things like, "I never saw him and we never kissed"</l>
<l>Now I think somehow in my mind</l>
<l>If I could convince him, if he doesn't see it, then maybe it doesn't exist</l>
<l>I think he's onto me every time I say I'm over that son of a bitch</l>
<l>I'm lying to my therapist</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I deserve an hour in a week to focus on my thoughts</l>
<l>Not so obsessed with yours, I can't hear myself speak</l>
<l>I deserve my own consideration, but sometimes, I wish I kept</l>
<l>Some of my feelings in the basement so I'd still have some left</l>
