<l>Think I only want one number in my phone</l>
<l>I might change your contact to "Don't Leave Me Alone"</l>

<l>But I can't help myself when you get close to me</l>
<l>Baby, my tongue goes numb, sounds like "bleh-blah-blee"</l>

<l>I'll be honest</l>
<l>Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense</l>

<l>And when you got your arms around me</l>
<l>Oh, it feels so good</l>
<l>I had to jump the octave</l>
<l>I think I got an ex, but I forgot him</l>
<l>And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it</l>
<l>I don't even know, I'm talkin' nonsense</l>

<l>I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks</l>
<l>I'm talkin' opposite of soft</l>

<l>You gotta keep up with me</l>
<l>I got some young energy</l>
<l>I caught the L-O-V-E</l>
<l>How do you do this to me?</l>

<l>This song catchier than chickenpox is</l>
<l>I bet your house is where my other sock is</l>
<l>Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit, ha-ha</l>

<l>That one's not gonna make it</l>
<l>Most of these aren't gonna makeâ€”</l>
