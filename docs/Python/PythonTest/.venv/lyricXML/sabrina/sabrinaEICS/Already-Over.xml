<l>We been talkin' for hours</l>

<l>Yeah, I say I'm done, but I'm still confused</l>
<l>How am I supposed to close the door when I still need the closure?</l>
<l>And I change my mind, but it's still on you</l>

<l>Selfishly don't wanna give you</l>

<l>But I'll take three short hours over</l>
<l>Three long weeks pretendin' like we don't exist, hmm (Ah)</l>
