<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>One year, ten thousand bad moments</l>
<l>But it was dressed up in heated emotion</l>
<l>And I tried to look for the best in the worst</l>
<l>But like, fuck me, that caused a commotion</l>
<l>You're lucky I'm a private person</l>
<l>I've quietly carried your burden</l>
<l>And everyone thinks you're an angel</l>
<l>But shit, I would probably use different wordin'</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Oh, you're so vicious</l>
<l>Love me, then pretend you didn't</l>
<l>Crush my heart and wreck my image</l>
<l>Why you gotta be so vicious?</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>You like a certain type of woman</l>
<l>Who's smart, but neglects intuition</l>
<l>When you're insecure, could be me, could be her</l>
<l>You just run to whoever is winnin' (Ah)</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Said that it was me and you for life</l>
<l>Now you're kinda acting like I died</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Oh, you're so vicious</l>
<l>Love me, then pretend you didn't</l>
<l>Crush my heart and wreck my image</l>
<l>Why you gotta be so, so, so</l>
<l>Oh, you're so vicious (No)</l>
<l>Love me, then pretend you didn't</l>
<l>Half of me just can't resist it</l>
<l>Why you gotta be so vicious?</l>
</section>
<section type="post-chorus">
<l>Oh, no</l>
<l>Why you gotta be so</l>
<l>Oh, oh</l>
<l>Why you gotta be so vicious?</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>You don't feel remorse, you don't feel the effects</l>
<l>'Cause you don't think you hurt me if you wish me the best</l>
<l>I shoulda known all along, I was only the next one</l>
<l>To take your love songs as a promise</l>
</section>
<section type="outro">
<l>Oh, you're so vicious</l>
<l>I loved you, but I wish I didn't</l>
<l>If you're out there somewhere listenin'</l>
<l>Why you gotta be so vicious?</l>
