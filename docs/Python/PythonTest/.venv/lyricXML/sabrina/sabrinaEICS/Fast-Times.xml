<l>Sun's up too soon like daylight savings</l>
<l>Mixed emotions are congregating</l>
<l>Picturin' us in all these places</l>

<l>Sky looks so purple, I can taste it</l>
<l>Couple days in, I call you "baby"</l>
<l>Three stories up here contemplatin'</l>
<l>But what the fuck is patience?</l>

<l>Fast times and fast nights, yеah</l>
<l>Closed eyes and closed blinds, we couldn't help it</l>
<l>Outlines on bed sides, yeah</l>
<l>Give me a second to forget I ever really meant it</l>
