<l>I said I wanted Thin Mints and you said you knew a guy</l>
<l>You showed up with a boombox and stars in your eyes</l>
<l>Who knew cuddling on trampolines could be so reckless?</l>
<l>We bonded over Black Eyed Peas and complicated exes</l>

<l>Fell so deeply into it</l>

<l>Now I'm a homewrecker, I'm a slut</l>
<l>I got death threats fillin' up semitrucks</l>
<l>Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice</l>
<l>All because I liked</l>
<l>I'm the hot topic on your tongue</l>
<l>I'm a rebound gettin' 'round stealin' from the young</l>
<l>Tell me who I am, guess I don't have a choice</l>
<l>All because I liked a boy</l>

<l>I'm not catastrophizing, everything's derailing</l>
<l>Was only tryna hold you close while your heart was failing</l>
<l>It's not internet illusion, just two kids going through it</l>
<l>You said I'm too late to be your first love, but I'll always be your favorite</l>
