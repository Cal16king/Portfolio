<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I woke up this mornin' and I sat up straight in bed</l>
<l>I had the strangest feeling of this weight off of my chest</l>
<l>I hadn't felt that hopeful since the day that you left</l>
<l>And it felt nice, so nice</l>
<l>And everybody told me it would happen in time</l>
<l>The fire would burn out and all the storm clouds would subside</l>
<l>And I always believed that it was some comforting lie</l>
<l>But it feels nice, so nice</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete</l>
<l>And I can't even remember what made me lose all that sleep</l>
<l>I criеd a million rivers for you, but that's over now</l>
<l>You're just a strangеr I know everything about, ooh, ooh</l>
<l>You're just a stranger I know everything about</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Made a pot of coffee and I poured myself a cup</l>
<l>I thought of all the things I did to try and win your love</l>
<l>How did that happen? I can't imagine ever doing all that stuff for just some guy</l>
<l>Like, you're just some guy</l>
<l>Oh, but I hope that you're happy, babe, you know I really do</l>
<l>And God knows that I am the girl I am because of you</l>
<l>You know I'll always think of you, I'll love you 'til the end of time</l>
<l>You are the best thing that I'll ever keep so far out of my life</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Yeah, I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete</l>
<l>I can't even remember what made me lose all that sleep</l>
<l>I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now</l>
<l>You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh</l>
<l>You're just a stranger I know everything about</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>There's nothin' left for me to know</l>
<l>I had to stay, you had to go</l>
<l>And it was mean, but it doesn't matter anymore, no</l>
<l>There's nothin' left for me to sing</l>
<l>I screamed, I cried, I did the whole thing</l>
<l>And I loved you mad, but it doesn't matter anymore, no</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I was half myself without you, but now I feel so complete</l>
<l>And if I'm not enough for you, you're not enough for me</l>
<l>I fought a million battles, but you can't get to me now</l>
<l>You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh</l>
<l>You're just a stranger I know everything about</l>
<l>You're just a stranger I know everything about</l>
