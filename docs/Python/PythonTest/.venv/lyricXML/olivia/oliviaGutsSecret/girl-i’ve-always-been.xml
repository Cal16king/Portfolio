<l>"Baby doll, you have changed"</l>
<l>That's the thing you always say</l>
<l>Cursin' me, trash my name</l>
<l>I rained all over your parade</l>
<l>Now you're on my couch, you're fightin' tears</l>
<l>You say I'm cruel beyond my years</l>
<l>And as I'm walkin' out that door</l>
<l>Say you don't know me anymore</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Well, I have captors I call friends</l>
<l>I got panic rooms inside my head</l>
<l>And I get down with crooked men</l>
<l>But I am the girl I've always been</l>
<l>I got wrapped up in the game again</l>
<l>You woke up in an empty bed</l>
<l>And I can't say I'm a perfect ten</l>
<l>But I am the girl I've always been</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>So don't say that I've been actin' different</l>
<l>I'm nothin' if I'm not consistent</l>
<l>You knew everything you'd be gettin'</l>
<l>I told you right from the beginnin'</l>
<l>Now you're on my case, how could I go?</l>
<l>You never dreamed I'd be so cold</l>
<l>And then, with venom on your tongue</l>
<l>You ask me who I have become</l>
