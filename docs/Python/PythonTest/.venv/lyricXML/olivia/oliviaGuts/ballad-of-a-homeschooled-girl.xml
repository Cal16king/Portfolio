<l>Cat got my tongue</l>
<l>And I don't think I get along with anyone</l>
<l>Blood runnin' cold</l>
<l>I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke</l>
<l>And I hate all my clothes</l>
<l>Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones</l>
<l>So I guess I should go</l>
<l>The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know</l>
<l>I know, I know</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I broke a glass, I tripped and fell</l>
<l>I told secrets I shouldn't tell</l>
<l>I stumbled over all my words</l>
<l>I made it weird, I made it worse</l>
<l>Each time I step outside, it's social suicide</l>
<l>It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die</l>
<l>It's social suicide</l>

<l>I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (Uh-huh)</l>
<l>Sеarchin' "how to start a conversation?" on a website (How to flirt?)</l>
<l>I talkеd to this hot guy, swore I was his type</l>
<l>Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like, the whole night (Oh)</l>
<l>Everythin' I do is tragic (Oh)</l>
<l>Every guy I like is gay (Oh)</l>
<l>The morning after I panic (Oh)</l>
<l>Oh, God, what did I say? (Oh, oh, oh)</l>
