<l>Hey</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Haven't heard from you in a couple of months</l>
<l>But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up</l>
<l>And you're callin' my phone, you're all alone</l>
<l>And I'm sensing some undertone</l>
<l>And I'm right here with all my friends</l>
<l>But you're sending me your new address</l>
<l>And I know we're done, I know we're through</l>
<l>But, God, when I look at you</l>
</section>
<section type="refrain">
<l>My brain goes, "Ah"</l>
<l>Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)</l>
<l>Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)</l>
<l>Should probably not</l>
<l>I should probably, probably not</l>
<l>I should probably, probably not</l>

<l>Seeing you tonight</l>
<l>It's a bad idea, right?</l>
<l>Seeing you tonight</l>
<l>It's a bad idea, right?</l>
<l>Seeing you tonight</l>
<l>It's a bad idea, right?</l>
<l>Seeing you tonight</l>
<l>Fuck it, it's fine</l>

<l>Yes, I know that he's my ex</l>
<l>But can't two people reconnect?</l>
<l>I only see him as a friend</l>
<l>The biggest lie I ever said</l>
<l>Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex</l>
<l>But can't two people reconnect?</l>
<l>I only see him as a friend</l>
<l>I just tripped and fell into his bed</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans</l>
<l>I know I should stop, but I can't</l>
<l>And I told my friends I was asleep</l>
<l>But I never said where or in whose sheets</l>
<l>And I pull up to your place on the second floor</l>
<l>And you're standing, smiling at the door</l>
<l>And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men</l>
<l>But I really can't remember when</l>
