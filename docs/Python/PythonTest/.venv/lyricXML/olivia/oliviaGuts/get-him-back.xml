<l>One, two, three</l>
<l>Wait, is this the song with the drums?</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring</l>
<l>He argued with me about everything</l>
<l>He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye</l>
<l>He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"</l>
<l>But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends</l>
<l>And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end</l>
<l>Another song, another club, another bar, another dance</l>
<l>And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе</l>
<l>So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed</l>
<l>'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend</l>
<l>Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down</l>
<l>If I had to choose, I would say right now</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I wanna get him back</l>
<l>I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad</l>
<l>Oh, I wanna get him back</l>
<l>'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad</l>
<l>Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again</l>
<l>I want to get him back, back, back</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash</l>
<l>'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh</l>
<l>Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "send"</l>
<l>I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends</l>
<l>Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do</l>
<l>He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth</l>
<l>And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'</l>
<l>But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him</l>

<l>Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again</l>
<l>I want to get him back (And then? And then)</l>
<l>I want to get him back, back, back</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)</l>
<l>I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back; Woo)</l>
<l>I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back; Yeah, you got it)</l>
<l>Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah)</l>
<l>Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)</l>
<l>With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)</l>
<l>I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)</l>
<l>Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back)</l>
<l>Oh, I wanna key his car, I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back; I want to)</l>
<l>I wanna break his heart, stitch it right back up (But then I, I want to get him back; get him back)</l>
<l>I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back; I want to)</l>
<l>I wanna meet his mom, and tell her her son sucks, yeah (But then I, I want to get him back; get him back)</l>
