<l>When am I gonna stop being wise beyond my years and just start being wise?</l>
<l>When am I gonna stop being a pretty young thing to guys?</l>
<l>When am I gonna stop being great for my age and just start being good?</l>
<l>When will it stop being cool to be quietly misunderstood?</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me</l>
<l>Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen</l>
<l>But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me</l>
<l>And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough?</l>
<l>When will everyone have every reason to call all my bluffs?</l>
<l>And when are all my excuses of learning my lessons gonna start to feel sad?</l>
<l>Will I spend all the rest of my years wishing I could go back?</l>
