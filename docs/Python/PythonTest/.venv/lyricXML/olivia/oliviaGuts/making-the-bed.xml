<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done</l>
<l>Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun</l>
<l>Another piece of plastic I could just throw away</l>
<l>Another conversation with nothing good to say</l>
<l>I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can</l>
<l>Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am</l>
<l>Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine</l>
<l>Another thing I forced to be a sign</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am</l>
<l>Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends</l>
<l>Push away all the people who know me the best</l>
<l>But it's me who's been makin' the bed</l>
<l>I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am</l>
<l>Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread</l>
<l>And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head</l>
<l>But it's me who's been makin' the bed</l>
</section>
<section type="post-chorus">
<l>Me who's been makin' the bed</l>
<l>Pull the sheets over my head, yeah</l>
<l>Makin' the bed</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream</l>
<l>Where I'm drivin' through the city and the brakes go out on me</l>
<l>I can't stop at the red light, I can't swerve off the road</l>
<l>I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control</l>
<l>And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction</l>
<l>They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction</l>
<l>They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen</l>
<l>I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined</l>
