<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Bought a bunch of makeup, tryna cover up my face</l>
<l>I started to skip lunch, stopped eatin' cake on birthdays</l>
<l>I bought a new prescription to try and stay calm</l>
<l>'Cause there's always somethin' missin'</l>
<l>There's always somethin' in the mirror that I think looks wrong</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>When pretty isn't pretty enough, what do you do?</l>
<l>And everybody's keepin' it up, so you think it's you</l>
<l>I could change up my body and change up my face</l>
<l>I could try every lipstick in every shade</l>
<l>But I'd always feel the same</l>
<l>'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyway</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>You can win the battle, but you'll never win the war</l>
<l>You fix thе things you hated, and you'd still feel so insecure</l>
<l>And I try to ignorе it, but it's everythin' I see</l>
<l>It's on the poster on the wall, it's in the shitty magazines</l>
<l>It's in my phone, it's in my head, it's in the boys I bring to bed</l>
<l>It's all around, it's all the time, I don't know why I even try</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>And I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy</l>
<l>I chased some dumb ideal my whole fucking life</l>
<l>And none of it matters, and none of it ends</l>
<l>You just feel like shit over and over again</l>

<section type="outro">
<l>No, it'll never change</l>
<l>Pretty isn't pretty enough, mmm</l>
<l>Everybody's keepin' it up, oh</l>
<l>Pretty isn't pretty enough</l>
<l>Pretty isn't</l>
