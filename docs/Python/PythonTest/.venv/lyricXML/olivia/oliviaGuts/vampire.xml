<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now</l>
<l>How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?</l>
<l>Just what you wanted</l>
<l>Look at you, cool guy, you got it</l>
<l>I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes</l>
<l>Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise</l>
<l>I loved you truly</l>
<l>You gotta laugh at the stupidity</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause I've made some real big mistakes</l>
<l>But you make the worst one look fine</l>
<l>I should've known it was strange</l>
<l>You only come out at night</l>
<l>I used to think I was smart</l>
<l>But you made me look so naive</l>
<l>The way you sold me for parts</l>
<l>As you sunk your teeth into me, oh</l>
<l>Bloodsucker, fame fucker</l>
<l>Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news</l>
<l>You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too</l>
<l>You're so convincing</l>
<l>How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)</l>
<l>Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill</l>
<l>Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will</l>
<l>Went for me and not her</l>
<l>'Cause girls your age know better</l>

<l>(Ah)</l>
<l>You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?</l>
<l>You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart</l>
<l>I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't</l>
<l>'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand</l>
