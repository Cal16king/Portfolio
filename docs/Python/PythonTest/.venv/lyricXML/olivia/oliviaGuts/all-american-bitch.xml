<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board</l>
<l>I pay attention to things that most people ignore</l>
<l>And I'm alright with the movies</l>
<l>That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure</l>
<l>And I am built like a mother and a total machine</l>
<l>I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean</l>
<l>And I make light of the darkness</l>
<l>I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe</l>
<l>Yeah, you know me, I</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Forgive, and I forget</l>
<l>I know my age and I act like it</l>
<l>Got what you can't resist</l>
<l>I'm a perfect all-American</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air</l>
<l>Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair</l>
<l>I got class and integrity</l>
<l>Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear</l>
<l>With love to spare, I</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Forgive and I forget</l>
<l>I know my age and I act like it</l>
<l>Got what you can't resist</l>
<l>I'm a perfect all-American bitch</l>
<l>With perfect all-American lips</l>
<l>And perfect all-American hips</l>
<l>I know my place</l>
<l>I know my place and this is it</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>I don't get angry when I'm pissed</l>
<l>I'm the eternal optimist</l>
<l>I scream inside to deal with it, like, "Ah"</l>
<l>Like, "Ah" (Oh, my fucking God, yeah)</l>
</section>
<section type="outro">
<l>All the time</l>
<l>I'm grateful all the time</l>
<l>I'm sexy and I'm kind</l>
<l>I'm pretty when I cry</l>
<l>Oh, all the time</l>
<l>I'm grateful all the time (Grateful all the fucking time)</l>
<l>I'm sexy and I'm kind</l>
<l>I'm pretty when I cry</l>
