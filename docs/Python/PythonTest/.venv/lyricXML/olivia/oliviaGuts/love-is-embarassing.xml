<l>I told my friends you were the one</l>
<l>After I'd known you, like, a month</l>
<l>And then you kissed some girl from high school</l>
<l>And I stayed in bed for, like, a week</l>
<l>When you said space was what you need</l>
<l>Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And now it don't mean a thing</l>
<l>God, love's fuckin' embarrassin'</l>
<l>Just watch as I crucify myself</l>
<l>For some weird second string</l>
<l>Loser who's not worth mentioning</l>
<l>My God, love's embarrassing as hell</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And I consoled you while you cried</l>
<l>Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy</l>
<l>My God, how could I be so stupid?</l>
<l>You found a new version of me</l>
<l>And I damn near startеd World War III</l>
<l>Jesus, what was I even doin'?</l>
