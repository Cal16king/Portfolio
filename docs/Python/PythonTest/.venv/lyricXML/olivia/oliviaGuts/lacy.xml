<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Lacy, oh Lacy, skin like puff pastry</l>
<l>Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?</l>
<l>Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies</l>
<l>Did I ever tell you that I’m not doin' well?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Ooh, I care, I care, I care</l>
<l>Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time</l>
<l>Watching, hidden in plain sight</l>
<l>And ooh, I try, I try, I try</l>
<l>But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere</l>
<l>The sweetest torture one could bear</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin’ it lately</l>
<l>I feel your compliments likе bullets on skin</l>
<l>Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnatе</l>
<l>Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Ooh, I care, I care, I care</l>
<l>Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots</l>
<l>You got the one thing that I want</l>
<l>Ooh, I try, I try, I try</l>
<l>Try to rationalize, people are people</l>
<l>But it's like you're made of angel dust</l>

<l>Oh, oh, oh</l>
<l>Oh, oh, oh, oh</l>
<l>Oh, oh, oh, oh</l>
<l>Oh, oh, oh</l>

<section type="outro">
<l>Lacy, oh Lacy, it's like you're out to get me</l>
<l>You poison every little thing that I do</l>
<l>Lacy, oh Lacy, I just loathe you lately</l>
<l>And I despise my jealous eyes and how hard they fell for you</l>
<l>Yeah, I despise my rotten mind and how much it worships you</l>
