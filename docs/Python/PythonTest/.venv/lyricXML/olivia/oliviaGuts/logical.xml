<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Master manipulator</l>
<l>God, you're so good at what you do</l>
<l>Come for me like a savior</l>
<l>And I'd put myself through hell for you</l>
<l>Hear all the rumors lately</l>
<l>That you always denied</l>
<l>And I fell for you like water</l>
<l>Falls from the February sky</l>
<l>But now the current's stronger</l>
<l>No, I couldn't get out if I tried</l>
<l>But you convinced me, baby</l>
<l>It was all in my mind</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And now you got me thinkin'</l>
<l>Two plus two equals five</l>
<l>And I'm the love of your life</l>
<l>'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine</l>
<l>Then changing you is possible</l>
<l>No, love is never logical</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>You built a giant castle</l>
<l>With walls so high I couldn't see</l>
<l>The way it all unraveled</l>
<l>And all the things you did to me</l>
<l>You lied, you lied, you lied, oh</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And now you got me thinkin'</l>
<l>Two plus two equals five</l>
<l>And I'm the love of your life</l>
<l>'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine</l>
<l>Then changing you is possible</l>
<l>I guess love is never logical</l>
<l>The sky is green, the grass is red</l>
<l>And you mean all those words you said</l>
<l>I'm sure that girl is really your friend</l>
<l>Our problems are all solvable</l>
<l>'Cause loving you is loving every</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>Argument you held over my head</l>
<l>Brought up the girls you could have instead</l>
<l>Said I was too young, I was too soft</l>
<l>Can't take a joke, can't get you off</l>
<l>Oh, why do I do this?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I look so stupid thinkin'</l>
<l>Two plus two equals five</l>
<l>And I'm the love of your life</l>
<l>'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine</l>
<l>Then changing you is possible (Ah, ah)</l>
<l>No, love is never logical</l>
</section>
<section type="outro">
<l>Logical, logical</l>
<l>Love is never logical</l>
<l>I know I'm half responsible</l>
<l>And that makes me feel horrible</l>
<l>Oh, logical, logical</l>
<l>Love is never logical</l>
<l>I know I could've stopped it all</l>
<l>God, why didn't I stop it all?</l>
<l>Oh, logical, logical</l>
<l>Love is never logical</l>
<l>I know I'm half responsible</l>
<l>And that makes me feel horrible</l>
<l>Oh, logical, logical</l>
<l>Love is never logical</l>
<l>I know I could've stopped it all</l>
<l>God, why didn't I stop it all?</l>
