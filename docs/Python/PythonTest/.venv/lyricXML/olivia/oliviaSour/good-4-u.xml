<l>Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily</l>
<l>You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks</l>
<l>Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?</l>
<l>(World)</l>
<l>And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself</l>
<l>I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped</l>
<l>Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)</l>

<l>Well, good for you</l>
<l>You look happy and healthy, not me</l>
<l>If you ever cared to ask</l>
<l>Good for you</l>
<l>You're doin' great out there without me, baby</l>
<l>God, I wish that I could do that</l>
<l>I've lost my mind, I've spent the night</l>
<l>Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom</l>
<l>But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it</l>
<l>But I guess good for you</l>

<l>Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)</l>
<l>You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)</l>
<l>It's like we never even happened</l>
<l>Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)</l>
<l>And good for you, it's like you never even met me</l>
<l>Remember when you swore to God I was the only</l>
<l>Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you</l>
<l>You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do</l>
