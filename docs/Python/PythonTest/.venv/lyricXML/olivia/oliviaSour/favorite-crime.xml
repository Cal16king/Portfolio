<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Know that I loved you so bad</l>
<l>I let you treat me like that</l>
<l>I was your willing accomplice, honey</l>
<l>And I watched as you fled the scene</l>
<l>Doe-eyed as you buried me</l>
<l>One heart broke, four hands bloody</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>The things I did</l>
<l>Just so I could call you mine</l>
<l>The things you did</l>
<l>Well, I hope I was your favorite crime</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>You used me as an alibi</l>
<l>I crossed my heart as you crossed the line</l>
<l>And I defended you to all my friends</l>
<l>And now every time a siren sounds</l>
<l>I wondеr if you're around</l>
<l>'Cause you know that I'd do it all again</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>All the things I did</l>

<l>It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do</l>
<l>'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you</l>
<l>Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made</l>
<l>But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face</l>
<l>Oh, look what we became</l>
