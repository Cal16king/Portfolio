<l>I wore makeup when we dated</l>
<l>'Cause I thought you'd like me more</l>
<l>If I looked like the other prom queens</l>
<l>I know that you loved before</l>
<l>Tried so hard to be everything that you liked</l>
<l>Just for you to say you're not the compliment type</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And I knew how you took your coffee</l>
<l>And your favorite songs by heart</l>
<l>I read all of your self-help books</l>
<l>So you'd think that I was smart</l>
<l>Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me</l>
<l>I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>You found someonе more exciting, the nеxt second, you were gone</l>
<l>And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong</l>
<l>And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true</l>
<l>'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you</l>
<l>Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="3">
<l>And maybe I'm just not as interesting</l>
<l>As the girls you had before</l>
<l>But God, you couldn't have cared less</l>
<l>About someone who loved you more</l>
<l>I'd say you broke my heart</l>
<l>But you broke much more than that</l>
<l>Now, I don't want your sympathy</l>
<l>I just want myself back</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Before you found someone more exciting, the next second, you were gone</l>
<l>And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong</l>
<l>And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true</l>
<l>'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>And don't you think I loved you too much</l>
<l>To be used and discarded?</l>
<l>Don't you think I loved you too much</l>
<l>To think I deserve nothing?</l>
<l>But don't tell me you're sorry, boy</l>
<l>Feel sorry for yourself</l>
<l>'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else</l>
</section>
<section type="outro">
<l>And they'll think that I am so exciting</l>
<l>And you'll be the one who's crying</l>
<l>Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true</l>
<l>You say I'm never satisfied, but that's not me, it's you</l>
<l>'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough</l>
<l>But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you</l>
<l>Enough for you, oh</l>
<l>No, nothing's enough for you</l>
