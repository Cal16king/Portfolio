<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Called you on the phone today</l>
<l>Just to ask you how you were</l>
<l>All I did was speak normally</l>
<l>Somehow, I still struck a nerve</l>
<l>You got me fucked up in the head, boy</l>
<l>Never doubted myself so much</l>
<l>Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?</l>
<l>I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back</l>
<l>I'm the love of your life until I make you mad</l>
<l>It's always one step forward and three steps back</l>
<l>Do you love me, want me, hate me?</l>
<l>Boy, I don't understand</l>
<l>No, I don't understand</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And maybe in some masochistic way</l>
<l>I kind of find it all exciting</l>
<l>Like, which lover will I get today?</l>
<l>Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>It's one step forward and three steps back</l>
<l>I'm the love of your life until I make you mad</l>
<l>It's always one step forward and three steps back</l>
<l>Do you love me, want me, hate me?</l>
<l>Boy, I don't understand</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?</l>
<l>It's back and forth, going over everything I said</l>
<l>It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?</l>
<l>It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>It's one step forward and three steps back</l>
<l>And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had</l>
<l>Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back</l>
<l>Do you love me, want me, hate me?</l>
<l>Boy, I don't understand</l>
<l>No, I don't understand</l>
