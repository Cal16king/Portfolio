<l>I got my driver's license last week</l>
<l>Just like we always talked about</l>
<l>'Cause you were so excited for me</l>
<l>To finally drive up to your house</l>
<l>But today, I drove through the suburbs</l>
<l>Crying 'cause you weren't around</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And you're probably with that blonde girl</l>
<l>Who always made me doubt</l>
<l>She's so much older than me</l>
<l>She's everything I'm insecure about</l>
<l>Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs</l>
<l>'Cause how could I ever love someone else?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one</l>
<l>And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone</l>
<l>Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me</l>
<l>'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="3">
<l>And all my friends are tired</l>
<l>Of hearing how much I miss you, but</l>
<l>I kinda feel sorry for them</l>
<l>'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do</l>
<l>Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs</l>
<l>And pictured I was driving home to you</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh</l>
<l>And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone</l>
<l>I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me</l>
<l>'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>Red lights, stop signs</l>
<l>I still see your face in the white cars, front yards</l>
<l>Can't drive past the places we used to go to</l>
<l>'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)</l>
<l>Sidewalks we crossed</l>
<l>I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing</l>
<l>Over all the noise</l>
<l>God, I'm so blue, know we're through</l>
<l>But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)</l>
