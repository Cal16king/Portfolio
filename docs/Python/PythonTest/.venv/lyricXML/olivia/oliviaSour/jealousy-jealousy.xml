<l>I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room</l>
<l>'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true</l>
<l>With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies</l>
<l>Wish I didn't care</l>

<l>I know their beauty's not my lack</l>
<l>But it feels like that weight is on my back</l>
<l>And I can't let it go</l>

<l>Com-comparison is killin' me slowly</l>
<l>I think I think too much</l>
<l>'Bout kids who don't know me</l>
<l>I'm so sick of myself</l>
<l>I'd rather be, rather be</l>
<l>Anyone, anyone else</l>
<l>My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)</l>
<l>Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)</l>

<l>And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want</l>
<l>I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not</l>
<l>Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos, I can't stand it</l>
<l>Oh God, I sound crazy</l>

<l>Their win is not my loss</l>
<l>I know it's true, but</l>
<l>I can't help gettin' caught up in it all</l>

<l>All your friends are so cool, you go out every night</l>
<l>In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life</l>
<l>Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too</l>
<l>I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you</l>
<l>All I see is what I should be</l>

<l>All I see is what I should be</l>
<l>I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy</l>
