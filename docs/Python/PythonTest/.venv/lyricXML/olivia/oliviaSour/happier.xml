<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>We broke up a month ago</l>
<l>Your friends are mine, you know I know</l>
<l>You've moved on, found someone new</l>
<l>One more girl who brings out the better in you</l>
<l>And I thought my heart was detached</l>
<l>From all the sunlight of our past</l>
<l>But she's so sweet, she's so pretty</l>
<l>Does she mean you forgot about me?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Oh, I hope you're happy</l>
<l>But not like how you were with me</l>
<l>I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go</l>
<l>So find someone great, but don't find no one better</l>
<l>I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?</l>
<l>An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean</l>
<l>Remember when I believed</l>
<l>You meant it when you said it first to me?</l>
<l>And now I'm pickin' her apart</l>
<l>Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart</l>
<l>But she's beautiful, she looks kind</l>
<l>She probably gives you butterflies</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I hope you're happy</l>
<l>But not like how you were with me</l>
<l>I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go</l>
<l>So find someone great, but don't find no one better</l>
<l>I hope you're happy</l>
<l>I wish you all the best, really</l>
<l>Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me</l>
<l>And think of me fondly when your hands are on her</l>
<l>I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>Ooh, ooh-ooh</l>
<l>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I hope you're happy</l>
<l>Just not like how you were with me</l>
<l>I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go</l>

<l>I hope you're happy, but don't be happier</l>
