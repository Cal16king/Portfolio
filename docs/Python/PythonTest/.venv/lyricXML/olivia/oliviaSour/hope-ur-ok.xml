<l>I knew a boy once when I was small</l>
<l>A towhead blond with eyes of salt</l>
<l>He played the drum in the marching band</l>
<l>His parents cared more about the Bible</l>
<l>Than being good to their own child</l>
<l>He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad</l>
<l>And somehow, we fell out of touch</l>
<l>Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush</l>
<l>Don't know if I'll see you again someday</l>
<l>But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay</l>

<l>My middle school friend grew up alone</l>
<l>She raised her brothers on hеr own</l>
<l>Her parents hated who shе loved</l>
<l>She couldn't wait to go to college</l>
<l>She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world</l>
<l>Where family was merely blood</l>
<l>Does she know how proud I am she was created</l>
<l>With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?</l>
<l>We don't talk much, but I just gotta say</l>
<l>I miss you and I hope that you're okay</l>

<l>Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings</l>
<l>Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems</l>
<l>And when the clouds won't iron out</l>
<l>And the monsters creep into your house</l>
<l>And every door is hard to close</l>

<section type="outro">
<l>Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created</l>
<l>With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred</l>
<l>But, God, I hope that you're happier today</l>
<l>'Cause I love you</l>
<l>And I hope that you're okay</l>
