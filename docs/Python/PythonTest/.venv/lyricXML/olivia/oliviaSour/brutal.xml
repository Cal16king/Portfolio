<section type="intro">
<l>I want it to be, like, messy</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I'm so insecure, I think</l>
<l>That I'll die before I drink</l>
<l>And I'm so caught up in the news</l>
<l>Of who likes me and who hates you</l>
<l>And I'm so tired that I might</l>
<l>Quit my job, start a new life</l>
<l>And they'd all be so disappointed</l>
<l>'Cause who am I if not exploited?</l>
<l>And I'm so sick of seventeen</l>
<l>Where's my fucking teenage dream?</l>
<l>If someone tells me one more time</l>
<l>"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry</l>
<l>And I don't stick up for myself</l>
<l>I'm anxious, and nothing can help</l>
<l>And I wish I'd done this before</l>
<l>And I wish people liked me more</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>All I did was try my best</l>
<l>This the kinda thanks I get?</l>
<l>Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)</l>
<l>They say these are the golden years</l>
<l>But I wish I could disappear</l>
<l>Ego crush is so severe</l>
<l>God, it's brutal out here</l>
</section>
<section type="post-chorus">
<l>(Yeah)</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I feel like no one wants me</l>
<l>And I hate the way I'm perceived</l>
<l>I only have two real friends</l>
<l>And lately, I'm a nervous wreck</l>
<l>'Cause I love people I don't like</l>
<l>And I hate every song I write</l>
<l>And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart</l>
<l>And I can't even parallel park</l>

<l>Got a broken ego, broken heart</l>
