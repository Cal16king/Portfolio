<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I spy with my little tired eye</l>
<l>Tiny as a firefly</l>
<l>A pebble that we picked up last July</l>
<l>Down deep inside your pocket</l>
<l>We almost forgot it</l>
<l>Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?</l>
<l>Ooh, ooh</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>They said the end is comin'</l>
<l>Everyone’s up to somethin'</l>
<l>I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings</l>
<l>Outside, they’re push and shovin'</l>
<l>You're in the kitchen hummin'</l>
<l>All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>On the way home</l>
<l>I wrote a poem</l>
<l>You say, "What a mind"</l>
<l>This happens all the time</l>
<l>Ooh, ooh</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Causе they said the end is comin'</l>
<l>Evеryone's up to somethin’</l>
<l>I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings</l>
<l>Outside, they're push and shovin’</l>
<l>You're in the kitchen hummin'</l>
<l>All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors</l>
<l>And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other</l>
<l>And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"</l>
<l>To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it</l>
<l>Ooh</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>They said the end is comin'</l>
<l>Everyone's up to somethin'</l>
<l>I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings</l>
<l>Outside, they're push and shovin'</l>
<l>You're in the kitchen hummin'</l>
<l>All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'</l>
<l>They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')</l>
<l>Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')</l>
<l>I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings</l>
<l>Outside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')</l>
<l>You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')</l>
<l>All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'</l>
