<l>Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man</l>
<l>You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them</l>
<l>Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie</l>
<l>They say looks can kill and I might try</l>
<l>I don't dress for women</l>
<l>I don't dress for men</l>
<l>Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends</l>
<l>Don't get sad, get even</l>
<l>So on the weekends</l>
<l>I don't dress for friends</l>
<l>Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge</l>

<l>She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some</l>
<l>She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?</l>
<l>Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride</l>
<l>Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife</l>
<l>And she looks so pretty</l>
<l>Drivin' in your Benz</l>
<l>Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge</l>

<l>Ladies always rise above</l>
<l>Ladies know what people want</l>
<l>Someone sweet and kind and fun</l>
<l>The lady simply had enough</l>

<l>While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine</l>
<l>Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI</l>
<l>And I don't dress for villains</l>
<l>Or for innocents</l>
<l>I'm on my vigilante shit again</l>
