<l>You're talking shit for the hell of it</l>
<l>Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant</l>
<l>You're terrified to look down</l>
<l>'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare</l>
<l>Of everyone you burned just to get there</l>
<l>It's coming back around</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>And I keep my side of the street clean</l>
<l>You wouldn't know what I mean</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause karma is my boyfriend</l>
<l>Karma is a god</l>
<l>Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend</l>
<l>Karma's a relaxing thought</l>
<l>Aren't you envious that for you it's not?</l>
<l>Sweet like honey, karma is a cat</l>
<l>Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me</l>
<l>Flexing like a goddamn acrobat</l>
<l>Me and karma vibe like that</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Spiderboy, king of thieves</l>
<l>Weave your little webs of opacity</l>
<l>My pennies made your crown</l>
<l>Trick me once, trick me twice</l>
<l>Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?</l>
<l>It's coming back around</l>

<l>Ask me what I learned from all those years</l>
<l>Ask me what I earned from all those tears</l>
<l>Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here</l>
<l>(I'm still here, I'm still here)</l>

<section type="breakdown">
<l>'Cause karma is the thunder</l>
<l>Rattling your ground</l>
<l>Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter</l>
<l>Karma's gonna track you down</l>
<l>Step by step, from town to town</l>
<l>Sweet like justice, karma is a queen</l>
<l>Karma takes all my friends to the summit</l>
<l>Karma is the guy on the screen</l>
<l>Coming straight home to me</l>

<l>Aren't you envious that for you it's not?</l>
<l>Sweet like honey, karma is a cat</l>
