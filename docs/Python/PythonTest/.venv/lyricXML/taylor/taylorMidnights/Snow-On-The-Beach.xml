<l>One night, a few moons ago</l>
<l>I saw flecks of what could've been lights</l>
<l>But it might just have been you</l>
<l>Passing by unbeknownst to me</l>
<l>Life is emotionally abusive</l>
<l>And time can't stop me quite like you did</l>
<l>And my flight was awful, thanks for asking</l>
<l>I'm unglued, thanks to you</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>And it's like snow at the beach</l>
<l>Weird, but fuckin' beautiful</l>
<l>Flying in a dream</l>
<l>Stars by the pocketful</l>
<l>You wanting me</l>
<l>Tonight feels impossible</l>
<l>But it's comin' down</l>
<l>No sound, it's all around</l>

<section type="post-chorus">
<l>Like snow on the beach</l>
<l>Like snow on the beach</l>
<l>Like snow on the beach</l>
<l>Like snow, ah</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen</l>
<l>I searched "aurora borealis green"</l>
<l>I've never seen someone lit from within</l>
<l>Blurring out my periphery</l>
<l>My smile is like I won a contest</l>
<l>And to hide that would be so dishonest</l>
<l>And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it</l>
<l>'Til you do, 'til it's true</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Now it's like snow at the beach</l>
<l>Weird, but fuckin' beautiful</l>
<l>Flying in a dream</l>
<l>Stars by the pocketful</l>
<l>You wanting me</l>
<l>Tonight feels impossible</l>
<l>But it's comin' down</l>
<l>No sound, it's all around</l>

<l>I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it</l>
<l>I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it</l>
<l>But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet</l>
<l>Now I'm all for you like Janet</l>
<l>Can this be a real thing? Can it?</l>

<l>Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)</l>
<l>Weird, but fuckin' beautiful</l>

<l>You wanting me (You wanting me)</l>
