<section type="intro">
<l>Rain</l>
<l>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain</l>
<l>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name</l>
<l>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same</l>
<l>All of me changed like midnight</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>My town was a wasteland</l>
<l>Full of cages, full of fences</l>
<l>Pageant queens and big pretenders</l>
<l>But for some, it was paradise</l>
<l>My boy was a montage</l>
<l>A slow-motion, love potion</l>
<l>Jumping off things in the ocean</l>
<l>I broke his heart 'cause he was nice</l>
<l>He was sunshine, I was midnight rain</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain</l>
<l>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name</l>
<l>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same</l>
<l>All of me changed like midnight</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>It came like a postcard</l>
<l>Picture perfect shiny family</l>
<l>Holiday peppermint candy</l>
<l>But for him, it's every day</l>
<l>So I peered through a window</l>
<l>A deep portal, time travel</l>
<l>All the love we unravel</l>
<l>And the life I gave away</l>
<l>'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain</l>
<l>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name</l>
<l>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same</l>
<l>All of me changed like midnight rain</l>
<l>He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain</l>
<l>He wanted a bride, I was making my own name</l>
<l>Chasing that fame, he stayed the same</l>
<l>All of me changed like midnight</l>

<section type="outro">
<l>I guess sometimes we all get</l>
<l>Just what we wanted, just what we wanted</l>
<l>And he never thinks of me</l>
<l>Except for when I'm on TV</l>
<l>I guess sometimes we all get</l>
<l>Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted</l>
<l>And I never think of him</l>
<l>Except on midnights like this</l>
<l>(Midnights like this, midnights like this)</l>
