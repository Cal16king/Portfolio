<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Summer went away, still, the yearning stays</l>
<l>I play it cool with the best of them</l>
<l>I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me</l>
<l>It's okay, we're the best of friends</l>
<l>Anyway</l>
<l>I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys</l>
<l>I touch my phone as if it's your face</l>
<l>I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out</l>
<l>There's just one who could make me stay</l>
<l>All my days</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</l>
<l>I waited ages to see you there</l>
<l>I search the party of better bodies</l>
<l>Just to learn that you never cared</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>You're on your own, kid</l>
<l>You always have been</l>

<l>I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May</l>
<l>I picked the petals, he loves me not</l>
<l>Something different bloomed, writing in my room</l>
<l>I play my songs in the parking lot</l>
<l>I'll run away</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</l>
<l>I called a taxi to take me there</l>
<l>I search the party of better bodies</l>
<l>Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare</l>

<l>You're on your own, kid</l>
<l>You always have been</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</l>
<l>I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this</l>
<l>I hosted parties and starved my body</l>
<l>Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss</l>
<l>The jokes weren't funny, I took the money</l>
<l>My friends from home don't know what to say</l>
<l>I looked around in a blood-soaked gown</l>
<l>And I saw something they can't take away</l>
<l>'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned</l>
<l>Everything you lose is a step you take</l>
<l>So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it</l>
<l>You've got no reason to be afraid</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>You're on your own, kid</l>
<l>Yeah, you can face this</l>
<l>You're on your own, kid</l>
<l>You always have been</l>
