<l>I remember</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Good girl, sad boy</l>
<l>Big city, wrong choices</l>
<l>We had one thing goin' on</l>
<l>I swear that it was somethin'</l>
<l>'Cause I don't remember who I was</l>
<l>Before you painted all my nights</l>
<l>A color I've searched for since</l>
<l>But one thing after another</l>
<l>Fuckin' situations, circumstances</l>
<l>Miscommunications, and I</l>
<l>Have to say, by the way</l>
<l>I just may like some explanations</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Can I ask you a question?</l>
<l>Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room</l>
<l>And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you</l>
<l>But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?</l>
<l>Then what did you do?</l>
<l>Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh</l>
<l>Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh</l>
<l>When she said it was too much?</l>
<l>Do you wish you could still touch her?</l>
<l>It's just a question</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Half-moon eyes, bad surprise</l>
<l>Did you realize out of time?</l>
<l>She was on your mind with some dickhead guy</l>
<l>That you saw that night</l>
<l>But you were on somethin'</l>
<l>It was one drink after another</l>
<l>Fuckin' politics and gender roles</l>
<l>And you're not sure and I don't know</l>
<l>Got swept away in the gray</l>
<l>I just may like to have a conversation</l>
</section>

<section type="bridge">
<l>Does it feel like everything's just like</l>
<l>Second best after that meteor strike?</l>
<l>And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?</l>
<l>That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable</l>
<l>And right, but tonight</l>
