<l>I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser</l>
<l>Midnights become my afternoons</l>
<l>When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people</l>
<l>I've ghosted stand there in the room</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>I should not be left to my own devices</l>
<l>They come with prices and vices</l>
<l>I end up in crisis</l>
<l>(Tale as old as time)</l>
<l>I wake up screaming from dreaming</l>
<l>One day, I'll watch as you're leaving</l>
<l>'Cause you got tired of my scheming</l>
<l>(For the last time)</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>It's me, hi</l>
<l>I'm the problem, it's me</l>
<l>At teatime, everybody agrees</l>
<l>I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror</l>
<l>It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby</l>
<l>And I'm a monster on the hill</l>
<l>Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city</l>
<l>Pierced through the heart, but never killed</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism</l>
<l>Like some kind of congressman?</l>
<l>(A tale as old as time)</l>
<l>I wake up screaming from dreaming</l>
<l>One day, I'll watch as you're leaving</l>
<l>And life will lose all its meaning</l>
<l>(For the last time)</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>It's me, hi</l>
<l>I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)</l>
<l>At teatime, everybody agrees</l>
<l>I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror</l>
<l>It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money</l>
<l>She thinks I left them in the will</l>
<l>The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out</l>
<l>"She's laughing up at us from Hell"</l>

<l>It's me, hi</l>

<l>It's me, hi (Hi)</l>
<l>I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)</l>

<l>I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror</l>
<l>It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero</l>
