<l>When the morning came</l>
<l>We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf</l>
<l>'Cause we lost track of time again</l>
<l>Laughing with my feet in your lap</l>
<l>Like you were my closest friend</l>
<l>"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say</l>
<l>"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"</l>
<l>I see you every day now</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>And I chose you</l>
<l>The one I was dancing with</l>
<l>In New York, no shoes</l>
<l>Looked up at the sky and it was</l>
<l>The burgundy on my t-shirt</l>
<l>When you splashed your wine into me</l>
<l>And how the blood rushed into my cheeks</l>
<l>So scarlet, it was</l>
<l>The mark thеy saw on my collarbone</l>
<l>The rust that grew bеtween telephones</l>
<l>The lips I used to call home</l>
<l>So scarlet, it was maroon</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>When the silence came</l>
<l>We were shaking, blind and hazy</l>
<l>How the hell did we lose sight of us again?</l>
<l>Sobbing with your head in your hands</l>
<l>Ain't that the way shit always ends?</l>
<l>You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway</l>
<l>Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us</l>
<l>I feel you, no matter what</l>
<l>The rubies that I gave up</l>
