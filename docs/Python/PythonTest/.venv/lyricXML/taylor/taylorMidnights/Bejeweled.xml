<l>Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind</l>
<l>Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind</l>
<l>In the shoes I gave you as a present</l>
<l>Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five</l>
<l>And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Best believe I'm still bejeweled</l>
<l>When I walk in the room</l>
<l>I can still make the whole place shimmer</l>
<l>And when I meet the band</l>
<l>They ask, "Do you have a man?"</l>
<l>I could still say, "I don't remember"</l>
<l>Familiarity breeds contempt</l>
<l>Don't put mе in the basement</l>
<l>Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart</l>
<l>Diamonds in my eyes</l>
<l>I polish up real, I polish up real nice</l>

<l>Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)</l>
<l>Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve</l>
<l>I think it's time to teach some lessons</l>
<l>I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)</l>
<l>I can reclaim the land</l>
<l>And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)</l>
