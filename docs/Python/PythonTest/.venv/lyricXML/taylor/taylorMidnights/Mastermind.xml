<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Once upon a time, the planets and the fates</l>
<l>And all the stars aligned</l>
<l>You and I ended up in the same room</l>
<l>At the same time</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>And the touch of a hand lit the fuse</l>
<l>Of a chain reaction of countermoves</l>
<l>To assess the equation of you</l>
<l>Checkmate, I couldn't lose</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>What if I told you none of it was accidental?</l>
<l>And the first night that you saw me</l>
<l>Nothing was gonna stop me</l>
<l>I laid the groundwork, and then</l>
<l>Just like clockwork</l>
<l>The dominoes cascaded in a line</l>
<l>What if I told you I'm a mastermind?</l>
<l>And now you're mine</l>
<l>It was all by dеsign</l>
<l>'Cause I'm a mastermind</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>You see, all the wisеst women</l>
<l>Had to do it this way</l>
<l>'Cause we were born to be the pawn</l>
<l>In every lover's game</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>If you fail to plan, you plan to fail</l>
<l>Strategy sets the scene for the tale</l>
<l>I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails</l>
<l>And the liquor in our cocktails</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>What if I told you none of it was accidental?</l>
<l>And the first night that you saw me</l>
<l>I knew I wanted your body</l>
<l>I laid the groundwork, and then</l>
<l>Just like clockwork</l>
<l>The dominoes cascaded in a line</l>
<l>What if I told you I'm a mastermind?</l>
<l>And now you're mine</l>
<l>It was all my design</l>
<l>'Cause I'm a mastermind</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>No one wanted to play with me as a little kid</l>
<l>So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since</l>
<l>To make them love me and make it seem effortless</l>
<l>This is the first time I've felt the need to confess</l>
<l>And I swear</l>
<l>I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian</l>
<l>'Cause I care</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>So I told you none of it was accidental</l>
<l>And the first night that you saw me</l>
<l>Nothing was gonna stop me</l>
<l>I laid the groundwork, and then</l>
<l>Saw a wide smirk on your face</l>
<l>You knew the entire time</l>
<l>You knew that I'm a mastermind</l>
<l>And now you're mine</l>
<l>Yeah, all you did was smile</l>
<l>'Cause I'm a mastermind</l>
