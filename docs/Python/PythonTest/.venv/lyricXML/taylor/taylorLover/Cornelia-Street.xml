<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>We were in the backseat</l>
<l>Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar</l>
<l>"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"</l>
<l>I say casually in the car</l>
<l>We were a fresh page on the desk</l>
<l>Filling in the blanks as we go</l>
<l>As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head</l>
<l>Leading us home</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>
<l>That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>
<l>And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name</l>
<l>And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Windows flung right open, autumn air</l>
<l>Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours</l>
<l>We bless the rains on Cornelia Street</l>
<l>Memorize the creaks in the floor</l>
<l>Back when we were card sharks, playing games</l>
<l>I thought you were leading me on</l>
<l>I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street</l>
<l>Before you even knew I was gone</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>But then you called, showed your hand</l>
<l>I turned around before I hit the tunnel</l>
<l>Sat on the roof, you and I</l>

<l>I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>
<l>That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>
<l>And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)</l>
<l>And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>
<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>You hold my hand on the street</l>
<l>Walk me back to that apartment</l>
<l>Years ago, we were just inside</l>
<l>Barefoot in the kitchen</l>
<l>Sacred new beginnings</l>
<l>That became my religion, listen</l>

<l>Oh, never again</l>

<l>I'd never walk Cornelia Street again</l>
