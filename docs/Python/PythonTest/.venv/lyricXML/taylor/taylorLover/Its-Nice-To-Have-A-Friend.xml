<l>School bell rings, walk me home</l>
<l>Sidewalk chalk covered in snow</l>
<l>Lost my gloves, you give me one</l>
<l>"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun</l>
<l>Video games, you pass me a note</l>
<l>Sleeping in tents</l>

<l>Light pink sky, up on the roof</l>
<l>Sun sinks down, no curfew</l>
<l>Twenty questions, we tell the truth</l>
<l>You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too</l>
<l>Something gave you the nerve</l>
<l>To touch my hand</l>

<l>Church bells ring, carry me home</l>
<l>Rice on the ground looks like snow</l>
<l>Call my bluff, call you "Babe"</l>
<l>Have my back, yeah, every day</l>
<l>Feels like home, stay in bed</l>
<l>The whole weekend</l>
