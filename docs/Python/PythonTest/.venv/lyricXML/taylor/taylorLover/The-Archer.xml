<l>Combat, I'm ready for combat</l>
<l>I say I don't want that, but what if I do?</l>
<l>'Cause cruelty wins in the movies</l>
<l>I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Easy they come, easy they go</l>
<l>I jump from the train, I ride off alone</l>
<l>I never grew up, it's getting so old</l>
<l>Help me hold on to you</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I've been the archer, I've been the prey</l>
<l>Who could ever leave me, darling</l>
<l>But who could stay?</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Dark side, I search for your dark side</l>
<l>But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?</l>
<l>And I cut off my nose just to spite my face</l>
<l>Then I hate my reflection for years and years</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost</l>
<l>The room is on fire, invisible smoke</l>
<l>And all of my heroes die all alone</l>
<l>Help me hold on to you</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I've been the archer, I've been the prey</l>
<l>Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling</l>
<l>But who could stay?</l>
<l>(I see right through me, I see right through me)</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>'Cause they see right through me</l>
<l>They see right through me</l>
<l>They see right through</l>
<l>Can you see right through me?</l>
<l>They see right through</l>
<l>They see right through me</l>
<l>I see right through me</l>
<l>I see right through me</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>All the king's horses, all the king's men</l>
<l>Couldn't put me together again</l>
<l>'Cause all of my enemies started out friends</l>
<l>Help me hold on to you</l>

<l>Who could stay?</l>
<l>Who could stay?</l>
<l>You could stay</l>
<l>You could stay</l>
