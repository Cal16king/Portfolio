<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue</l>
<l>Put you in jail for something you didn’t do</l>
<l>I pinned your hands behind your back, oh</l>
<l>Thought I had reason to attack, but no</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves</l>
<l>Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us</l>
<l>Why'd I have to break what I love so much?</l>
<l>It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Hey, it's all me, in my head</l>
<l>I'm the one who burned us down</l>
<l>But it's not what I meant</l>
<l>Sorry that I hurt you</l>
<l>I don't wanna do, I don’t wanna do this to you (Ooh)</l>
<l>I don’t wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)</l>
<l>I need to say, hey, it’s all me, just don't go</l>
<l>Meet me in the afterglow</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>It's so excruciating to see you low</l>
<l>Just wanna lift you up and not let you go</l>
<l>This ultraviolet morning light below</l>
<l>Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>I lived like an island, punished you with silence</l>
<l>Went off like sirens, just crying</l>
<l>Why'd I have to break what I love so much?</l>
<l>It’s on your face, don't walk away, I need to say</l>

<l>Hey, it's all me, in my head</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>Tell me that you're still mine</l>
<l>Tell me that we'll be just fine</l>
<l>Even when I lose my mind</l>
<l>I need to say</l>
<l>Tell me that it's not my fault</l>
<l>Tell me that I'm all you want</l>
<l>Even when I break your heart</l>
<l>I need to say</l>
