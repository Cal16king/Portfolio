<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January</l>
<l>And this is our place, we make the rules</l>
<l>And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear</l>
<l>Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Can I go where you go?</l>
<l>Can we always be this close?</l>
<l>Forever and ever, ah</l>
<l>Take me out and take me home</l>
<l>You're my, my, my, my lover</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>We could let our friends crash in the living room</l>
<l>This is our place, we make the call</l>
<l>And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you</l>
<l>I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Can I go where you go?</l>
<l>Can we always be this close?</l>
<l>Forever and ever, ah</l>
<l>Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)</l>
<l>You're my, my, my, my lover</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?</l>
<l>With every guitar string scar on my hand</l>
<l>I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover</l>
<l>My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue</l>
<l>All's well that ends well to end up with you</l>
<l>Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover</l>
<l>And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me</l>
<l>And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Can I go where you go?</l>
<l>Can we always be this close?</l>
<l>Forever and ever, ah</l>
<l>Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)</l>
<l>You're my, my, my, my</l>
<l>Oh, you're my, my, my, my</l>
<l>Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover</l>
