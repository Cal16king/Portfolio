<l>Fever dream high in the quiet of the night</l>
<l>You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</l>
<l>Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price</l>
<l>You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Killing me slow, out the window</l>
<l>I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below</l>
<l>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes</l>
<l>What doesn't kill me makes me want you more</l>

<l>And it's new, the shape of your body</l>
<l>It's blue, the feeling I've got</l>
<l>And it's ooh, woah-oh</l>
<l>It's a cruel summer</l>
<l>It's cool, that's what I tell 'em</l>
<l>No rules in breakable heaven</l>
<l>But ooh, woah-oh</l>
<l>It's a cruel summer with you</l>

<l>Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine</l>
<l>I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</l>

<l>We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)</l>

<l>So cut the headlights, summer's a knife</l>
<l>I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone</l>
<l>Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes</l>
<l>And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>I'm drunk in the back of the car</l>
<l>And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)</l>
<l>Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true</l>
<l>I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you</l>
<l>And I snuck in through the garden gate</l>
<l>Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)</l>
<l>And I scream, "For whatever it's worth</l>
<l>I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"</l>
<l>He looks up, grinnin' like a devil</l>
