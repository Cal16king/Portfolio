<l>Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts</l>
<l>Flashbacks waking me up</l>
<l>I get drunk, but it's not enough</l>
<l>’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby</l>
<l>I look through the windows of this love</l>
<l>Even though we boarded them up</l>
<l>Chandelier's still flickering here</l>
<l>’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not</l>
<l>It's death by a thousand cuts</l>

<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home</l>
<l>I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright</l>
<l>They say, "I don't know"</l>
<l>And what once was ours is no one's now</l>
<l>I see you everywhere, the only thing we share</l>
<l>Is this small town</l>
<l>You said it was a great love, one for the ages</l>
<l>But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?</l>

<l>My heart, my hips, my body, my love</l>
<l>Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch</l>
<l>Gave up on me like I was a bad drug</l>
<l>Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club</l>
<l>Our songs, our films, united we stand</l>
<l>Our country, guess it was a lawless land</l>
<l>Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand</l>
<l>Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans</l>
<l>My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust</l>
<l>Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up</l>
<l>Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough</l>
<l>But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts</l>
