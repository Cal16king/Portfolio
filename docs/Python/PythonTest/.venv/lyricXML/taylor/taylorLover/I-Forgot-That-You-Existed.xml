<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>How many days did I spend thinking</l>
<l>'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?</l>
<l>Lived in the shade you were throwing</l>
<l>'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone</l>
<l>And I couldn't get away from ya</l>
<l>In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah</l>
<l>Your name on my lips, tongue-tied</l>
<l>Free rent, living in my mind</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>But then something happened one magical night</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I forgot that you existed</l>
<l>And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't</l>
<l>And it was so nice</l>
<l>So peaceful and quiet</l>
<l>I forgot that you existed</l>
<l>It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference</l>
<l>I forgot that you</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Got out some popcorn</l>
<l>As soon as my rep started going down, down, down</l>
<l>Laughed on the school yard</l>
<l>As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground</l>
<l>And I would've stuck around for ya</l>
<l>Would've fought the whole town, so yeah</l>
<l>Would've been right there, front row</l>
<l>Even if nobody came to your show</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>But you showed who you are, then one magical night</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I forgot that you existed</l>
<l>And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't</l>
<l>And it was so nice</l>
<l>So peaceful and quiet</l>
<l>I forgot that you existed</l>
<l>It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference</l>
<l>I forgot that you</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>Sent me a clear message</l>
<l>Taught me some hard lessons</l>
<l>I just forget what they were</l>
<l>It's all just a blur</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I forgot that you existed</l>
<l>And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't</l>
<l>And it was so nice</l>
<l>So peaceful and quiet</l>
<l>I forgot that you existed</l>
<l>I did, I did, I did</l>
<l>It isn't hate, it's just indifference</l>
<l>It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference</l>
<l>So, yeah</l>
