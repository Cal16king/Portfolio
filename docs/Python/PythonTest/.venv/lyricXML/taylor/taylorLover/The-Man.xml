<l>I would be complex, I would be cool</l>
<l>They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to</l>
<l>And that would be okay for me to do</l>
<l>Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you</l>

<l>I’m so sick of running as fast as I can</l>
<l>Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man</l>
<l>And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again</l>
<l>'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man</l>
<l>I'd be the man (Man)</l>
<l>I’d be the man (Man)</l>

<l>They’d say I hustled, put in the work</l>
<l>They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve</l>

<l>What's it like to brag about raking in dollars</l>
<l>And getting bitches and models?</l>
<l>And it's all good if you're bad</l>
<l>And it's okay if you're mad</l>
<l>If I was out flashin' my dollars</l>
<l>I'd be a bitch, not a baller</l>
<l>They'd paint me out to be bad</l>
<l>So it's okay that I'm mad</l>
