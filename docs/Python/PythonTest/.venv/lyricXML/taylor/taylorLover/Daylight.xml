<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in</l>
<l>Everyone looked worse in the light</l>
<l>There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven</l>
<l>I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you</l>
<l>I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you</l>
<l>I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night</l>
<l>And now I see daylight, I only see daylight</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky</l>
<l>And so I became the butt of the joke</l>
<l>I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked</l>
<l>Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down</l>
<l>Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town</l>
<l>Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now</l>
<l>It's brighter now, now</l>

<l>I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you</l>
<l>(I can never look away)</l>
<l>I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you</l>
<l>(Things will never be the same)</l>
<l>I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night</l>
<l>(Now I'm wide awake)</l>
<l>And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)</l>

<l>And I can still see it all (In my mind)</l>
<l>All of you, all of me (Intertwined)</l>
<l>I once believed love would be (Black and white)</l>
<l>But it's golden (Golden)</l>
<l>And I can still see it all (In my head)</l>
<l>Back and forth from New York (Sneakin' in your bed)</l>
<l>I once believed love would be (Burnin' red)</l>
<l>But it's golden</l>
<l>Like daylight, like daylight</l>
<l>Like daylight, daylight</l>

<l>Like daylight</l>
<l>It's golden like daylight</l>
<l>You gotta step into the daylight and let it go</l>

<l>I wanna be defined by the things that I love</l>
<l>Not the things I hate</l>
<l>Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of</l>
<l>Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night</l>
<l>I, I just think that</l>
<l>You are what you love</l>
