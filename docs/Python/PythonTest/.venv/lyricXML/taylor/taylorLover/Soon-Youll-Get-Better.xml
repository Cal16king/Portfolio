<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair</l>
<l>In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared</l>
<l>That was the first time we were there</l>
<l>Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you</l>
<l>Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too</l>
<l>And I say to you</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Ooh-ah</l>
<l>Soon, you'll get better</l>
<l>Ooh-ah</l>
<l>Soon, you'll get better</l>
<l>Ooh-ah</l>
<l>You'll get better soon</l>
<l>'Cause you have to</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I know delusion when I see it in the mirror</l>
<l>You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal</l>
<l>I just pretend it isn't real</l>
<l>I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky</l>
<l>I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try</l>
<l>And I say to you</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>And I hate to make this all about me</l>
<l>But who am I supposed to talk to?</l>
<l>What am I supposed to do</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>This won't go back to normal, if it ever was</l>
<l>It's been years of hoping and I keep saying it because</l>
