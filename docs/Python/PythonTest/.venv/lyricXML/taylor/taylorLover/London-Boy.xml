<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal</l>
<l>And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey</l>

<l>You know I love a London boy</l>
<l>I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon</l>

<l>Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates</l>
