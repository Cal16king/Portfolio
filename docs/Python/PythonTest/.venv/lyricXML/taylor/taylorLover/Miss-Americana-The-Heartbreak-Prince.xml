<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you</l>
<l>Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene</l>
<l>Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing</l>
<l>I'm lost in the lights</l>
<l>American glory faded before me</l>
<l>Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress</l>
<l>Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard</l>
<l>And ran for my life (Ah)</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>No cameras catch my pageant smile</l>
<l>I counted days, I counted miles</l>
<l>To see you there, to see you there</l>
<l>It's been a long time coming, but</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>It's you and me, that's my whole world</l>
<l>They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)</l>
<l>The whole school is rolling fake dice</l>
<l>You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes</l>
<l>It's you and me, there's nothing like this</l>
<l>Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)</l>
<l>We're so sad, we paint the town blue</l>
<l>Voted most likely to run away with you</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>My team is losing, battered and bruising</l>
<l>I see the high fives between the bad guys</l>
<l>Leave with my head hung, you are the only one</l>
<l>Who seems to care</l>
<l>American stories burning before me</l>
<l>I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed</l>
<l>Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?</l>
<l>Darling, I'm scared (Ah)</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>No cameras catch my muffled cries</l>
<l>I counted days, I counted miles</l>
<l>To see you there, to see you there</l>
<l>And now the storm is coming, but</l>
