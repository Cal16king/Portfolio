<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>The moon is high</l>
<l>Like your friends were the night that we first met</l>
<l>Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet</l>
<l>Now I've read all of the books beside your bed</l>
<l>The wine is cold</l>
<l>Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street</l>
<l>Cat and mouse for a month or two or three</l>
<l>Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>(Ayy)</l>
<l>Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)</l>
<l>Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)</l>
<l>Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings</l>
<l>Uh-huh, that's right</l>
<l>Darling, you're the one I want, and</l>
<l>I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this</l>
<l>Uh-huh, that's right</l>
<l>Darling, you're the one I want</l>
<l>In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams</l>
<l>Oh, you're the one I want</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool</l>
<l>When you jumped in first, I went in too</l>
<l>I'm with you even if it makes me blue</l>
<l>Which takes me back</l>
<l>To the color that we painted your brother's wall</l>
<l>Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws</l>
<l>We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so</l>
