<l>I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh</l>
<l>I know I never think before I jump</l>
<l>And you're the kinda guy the ladies want</l>
<l>(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)</l>
<l>I know that I went psycho on the phone</l>
<l>I never leave well enough alone</l>
<l>And trouble's gonna follow where I go</l>

<l>And when we had that fight out in the rain</l>
<l>You ran after me and called my name</l>
<l>I never wanna see you walk away</l>
<l>(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)</l>
