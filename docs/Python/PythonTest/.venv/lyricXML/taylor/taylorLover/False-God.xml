<l>We were crazy to think</l>
<l>Crazy to think that this could work</l>
<l>Remember how I said I'd die for you?</l>
<l>We were stupid to jump</l>
<l>In the ocean separating us</l>
<l>Remember how I’d fly to you?</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>And I can't talk to you when you're like this</l>
<l>Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town</l>
<l>I'm New York City</l>
<l>I still do it for you, babe</l>
<l>They all warned us about times like this</l>
<l>They say the road gets hard and you get lost</l>
<l>When you're led by blind faith, blind faith</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>But we might just get away with it</l>
<l>Religion's in your lips</l>
<l>Even if it's a false god</l>
<l>We'd still worship</l>
<l>We might just get away with it</l>
<l>The altar is my hips</l>
<l>Even if it's a false god</l>
<l>We'd still worship this love</l>
<l>We’d still worship this love</l>
<l>We’d still worship this love</l>

<l>I know heaven's a thing</l>
<l>I go there when you touch me, honey</l>
<l>Hell is when I fight with you</l>
<l>But we can patch it up good</l>
<l>Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness</l>
<l>Got the wine for you</l>

<l>And you can't talk to me when I'm like this</l>
<l>Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you</l>
<l>You're the West Village</l>
<l>You still do it for me, babe</l>
<l>They all warned us about times like this</l>
<l>They say the road gets hard and you get lost</l>
