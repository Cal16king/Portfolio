<section type="intro">
<l>Gleaming, twinkling</l>
<l>Eyes like sinking</l>
<l>Ships on waters</l>
<l>So inviting, I almost jump in</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush</l>
<l>I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush</l>
<l>I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch</l>
<l>Everybody wants you</l>
<l>Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you</l>
<l>Walk past, quick brush</l>
<l>I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush</l>
<l>I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush</l>
<l>Everybody wants you</l>
<l>But I don't like a gold rush</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?</l>
<l>With your hair falling into place like dominoes</l>
<l>I see me padding across your wooden floors</l>
<l>With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door</l>
</section>
<section type="refrain">
<l>At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit</l>
<l>And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it</l>
<l>And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea</l>
<l>'Cause it could never be</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush</l>
<l>I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush</l>
<l>I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch</l>
<l>Everybody wants you</l>
<l>Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you</l>
<l>Walk past, quick brush</l>
<l>I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush</l>
<l>I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?</l>
<l>With your hair falling into place like dominoes</l>
<l>My mind turns your life into folklore</l>
<l>I can't dare to dream about you anymore</l>
</section>
<section type="refrain">
<l>At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit</l>
<l>And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it</l>
<l>'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea</l>
<l>'Cause it will never be</l>
