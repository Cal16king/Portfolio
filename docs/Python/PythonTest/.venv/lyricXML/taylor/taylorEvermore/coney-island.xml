<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Break my soul in two looking for you</l>
<l>But you're right here</l>
<l>If I can't relate to you anymore</l>
<l>Then who am I related to?</l>
<l>And if this is the long haul</l>
<l>How'd we get here so soon?</l>
<l>Did I close my fist around something delicate?</l>
<l>Did I shatter you?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island</l>
<l>Wondering, where did my baby go?</l>
<l>The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go</l>
<l>Sorry for not making you my centerfold</l>
<l>Over and over</l>
<l>Lost again with no surprises</l>
<l>Disappointments, close your eyes</l>
<l>And it gets colder and colder</l>
<l>When the sun goes down</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>The question pounds my head</l>
<l>What's a lifetime of achievement</l>
<l>If I pushed you to the edge</l>
<l>But you were too polite to leave me?</l>
<l>And do you miss the rogue</l>
<l>Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?</l>
<l>Will you forgive my soul</l>
<l>When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause we were like the mall before the internet</l>
<l>It was the one place to be</l>
<l>The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams</l>
<l>Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring</l>
<l>Over and over</l>
<l>Lost again with no surprises</l>
<l>Disappointments, close your eyes</l>
<l>And it gets colder and colder</l>
<l>When the sun goes down</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>Were you waiting at our old spot</l>
<l>In the tree line by the gold clock</l>
<l>Did I leave you hanging every single day?</l>
<l>Were you standing in the hallway</l>
<l>With a big cake, happy birthday</l>
<l>Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?</l>
<l>A universe away</l>
<l>And when I got into the accident</l>
<l>The sight that flashed before me was your face</l>
<l>But when I walked up to the podium</l>
<l>I think that I forgot to say your name</l>
