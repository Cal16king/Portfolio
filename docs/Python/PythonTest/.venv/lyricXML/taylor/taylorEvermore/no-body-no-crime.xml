<l>Este's a friend of mine</l>
<l>We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine</l>
<l>Este's been losin' sleep</l>
<l>Her husband's actin' different and it smells like infidelity</l>
<l>She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth</l>
<l>That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"</l>
<l>No, there ain't no doubt</l>
<l>I think I'm gonna call him out</l>

<l>No, no body, no crime</l>

<l>Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn</l>
<l>At her job or anywhere</l>
<l>Hе reports his missing wife</l>
<l>And I noticed when I passed his house</l>
<l>His truck has got some brand new tires</l>
<l>And his mistress moved in</l>
<l>Sleeps in Este's bed and everything</l>
<l>No, there ain't no doubt</l>
<l>Somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause</l>

<l>Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen</l>
<l>And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene</l>

<l>Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy</l>
