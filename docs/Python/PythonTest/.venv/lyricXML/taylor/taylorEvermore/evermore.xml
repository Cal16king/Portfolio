<l>Gray November</l>
<l>I've been down since July</l>
<l>Motion capture</l>
<l>Put me in a bad light</l>
<l>I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone</l>
<l>Trying to find the one where I went wrong</l>
<l>Writing letters</l>
<l>Addressed to the fire</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And I was catchin' my breath</l>
<l>Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death</l>
<l>And I couldn't be sure</l>
<l>I had a feeling so peculiar</l>
<l>That this pain would be for</l>
<l>Evermore</l>

<l>Hey, December</l>
<l>Guess I'm feeling unmoored</l>
<l>Can't remember</l>
<l>What I used to fight for</l>
<l>I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause</l>
<l>On thе very moment all was lost</l>
<l>Sending signals</l>
<l>To be double-crossed</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>And I was catchin' my breath</l>
<l>Barefoot in the wildest winter, catchin' my death</l>

<l>That this pain would be for</l>
<l>Evermore</l>

<l>Can't not think of all the cost</l>
<l>And the things that will be lost</l>
<l>Oh, can we just get a pause?</l>
<l>To be certain we'll be tall again</l>
<l>Whether weather be the frost</l>
<l>Or the violence of the dog days</l>
<l>I'm on waves, out being tossed</l>
<l>Is there a line that I could just go cross?</l>
<l>And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)</l>
<l>I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)</l>
<l>In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)</l>
<l>I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)</l>
<l>(If you think of all the cost)</l>
<l>It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)</l>
<l>To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)</l>
<l>(Or the violence of the dog days)</l>
<l>(Out on waves, being tossed)</l>
<l>(I'm on waves, out being tossed)</l>
<l>But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)</l>
<l>You were there</l>

<l>And I was catchin' my breath</l>
<l>Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step</l>

<l>This pain wouldn't be for</l>
<l>Evermore</l>

<l>Evermore (Evermore)</l>
