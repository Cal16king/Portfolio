<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?</l>
<l>When we were younger, down in the park</l>
<l>Honey, makin' a lark of the misery</l>
<l>You got shiny friends since you left town</l>
<l>A tiny screen's the only place I see you now</l>
<l>And I got nothin' but well wishes for ya</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Ooh</l>
<l>This place is the same as it ever was</l>
<l>Ooh</l>
<l>But you won't like it that way</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>It's never too late to come back to my side</l>
<l>The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo</l>
<l>And if you're ever tired of bеin' known for who you know</l>
<l>You know that you'll always know me</l>
<l>Dorothea, uh-uh</l>
<l>Dorothea, ah-ah</l>
</section>
<section type="post-chorus">
<l>Ooh</l>
<l>You'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines</l>
<l>Ooh</l>
<l>From you, I'd buy anything</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?</l>
<l>When it was calmer, skippin' the prom</l>
<l>Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes</l>
<l>And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya</l>
<l>But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well</l>
</section>
<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>Ooh</l>
<l>I guess I'll never know</l>
<l>Ooh</l>
<l>And you'll go on with the show</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>But it's never too late to come back to my side</l>
<l>The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo</l>
<l>And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know</l>
<l>You know, you'll always know me</l>
<l>Dorothea, uh-uh</l>
<l>Dorothea, ah-ah</l>

<l>Ooh, ooh</l>
