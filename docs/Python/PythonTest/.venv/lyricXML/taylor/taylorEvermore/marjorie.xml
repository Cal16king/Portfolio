<l>The autumn chill that wakes me up</l>
<l>You loved the amber skies so much</l>
<l>Long limbs and frozen swims</l>
<l>You'd always go past where our feet could touch</l>
<l>And I complained the whole way there</l>
<l>The car ride back and up the stairs</l>
<l>I should've asked you questions</l>
<l>I should've asked you how to be</l>
<l>Asked you to write it down for me</l>
<l>Should've kept every grocery store receipt</l>
<l>'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me</l>
<l>Watched as you signed your name Marjorie</l>
<l>All your closets of backlogged dreams</l>
<l>And how you left them all to me</l>

<l>And if I didn't know better</l>
<l>I'd think you were singing to me now</l>
<l>If I didn't know better</l>
<l>I'd think you were still around</l>
<l>I know better</l>
<l>But I still feel you all around</l>
<l>I know better</l>
<l>But you're still around</l>
