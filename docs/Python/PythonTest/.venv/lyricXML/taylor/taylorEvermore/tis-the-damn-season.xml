<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>If I wanted to know who you were hanging with</l>
<l>While I was gone, I would've asked you</l>
<l>It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass</l>
<l>But I felt it when I passed you</l>
<l>There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me</l>
<l>But if it's all the same to you</l>
<l>It's the same to me</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>So we could call it even</l>
<l>You could call me "babe" for the weekend</l>
<l>​'Tis the damn season, write this down</l>
<l>I'm stayin' at my parents' house</l>
<l>And the road not taken looks real good now</l>
<l>And it always leads to you and my hometown</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I parkеd my car right between the Methodist</l>
<l>And thе school that used to be ours</l>
<l>The holidays linger like bad perfume</l>
<l>You can run, but only so far</l>
<l>I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave</l>
<l>But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me</l>

<l>​'Tis the damn season, write this down</l>
<l>I'm stayin' at my parents' house</l>
<l>And the road not taken looks real good now</l>
<l>Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires</l>
<l>Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out</l>
<l>We could just ride around</l>
<l>And the road not taken looks real good now</l>
<l>And it always leads to you and my hometown</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake</l>
<l>I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay</l>
<l>So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends</l>
<l>Who'll write books about me if I ever make it</l>
<l>And wonder about the only soul</l>
<l>Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'</l>
<l>And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own</l>
<l>To leave the warmest bed I've ever known</l>
<l>We could call it even</l>
<l>Even though I'm leaving</l>
<l>And I'll be yours for the weekend</l>
<l>​'Tis the damn season</l>
