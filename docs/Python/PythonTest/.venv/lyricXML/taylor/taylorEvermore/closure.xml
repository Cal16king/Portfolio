<l>It's been a long time</l>
<l>And seeing the shape of your name</l>
<l>Still spells out pain</l>
<l>It wasn't right</l>
<l>The way it all went down</l>
<l>Looks like you know that now</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Yes, I got your letter</l>
<l>Yes, I'm doing better</l>
<l>It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone</l>
<l>Yes, I got your letter</l>
<l>Yes, I'm doing better</l>
<l>I know that it's over, I don't need your</l>
<l>Closure, your closure</l>

<l>Don't treat me like</l>
<l>Some situation that needs to be handled</l>
<l>I'm fine with my spite</l>
<l>And my tears and my beers and my candles</l>
<l>I can feel you smoothing me over</l>

<l>I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life</l>
<l>Staying friends would iron it out so nice</l>
<l>Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea</l>
<l>That you put between you and me</l>
<l>But it's fake and it's oh-so unnecessary</l>

<l>Your closure</l>
