<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I sit and watch you readin' with your head low</l>
<l>I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed</l>
<l>I sit and watch you</l>
<l>I notice everything you do or don't do</l>
<l>You're so much older and wiser, and I</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>I wait by the door like I'm just a kid</l>
<l>Use my best colors for your portrait</l>
<l>Lay the table with the fancy shit</l>
<l>And watch you tolerate it</l>
<l>If it's all in my head, tell me now</l>
<l>Tell me I've got it wrong somehow</l>
<l>I know my love should be celebrated</l>
<l>But you tolerate it</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I greet you with a battle hero's welcome</l>
<l>I take your indiscretions all in good fun</l>
<l>I sit and listеn</l>
<l>I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn</l>
<l>You're so much older and wiser, and I</l>

<l>While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?</l>
<l>Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?</l>
<l>I made you my temple, my mural, my sky</l>
<l>Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life</l>
<l>Drawin' hearts in the byline</l>
<l>Always takin' up too much space or time</l>
<l>You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)</l>

<l>Break free and leave us in ruins?</l>
<l>Took this dagger in me and removed it</l>
<l>Gain the weight of you, then lose it</l>
<l>Believe me, I could do it</l>
<l>If it's all in my head, tell me now</l>
<l>Tell me I've got it wrong somehow</l>
<l>I know my love should be celebrated</l>
<l>But you tolerate it</l>
