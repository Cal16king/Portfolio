<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>You booked the night train for a reason</l>
<l>So you could sit there in this hurt</l>
<l>Bustling crowds or silent sleepers</l>
<l>You're not sure which is worse</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Because I dropped your hand while dancing</l>
<l>Left you out there standing</l>
<l>Crestfallen on the landing</l>
<l>Champagne problems</l>
<l>Your mom's ring in your pocket</l>
<l>My picture in your wallet</l>
<l>Your heart was glass, I dropped it</l>
<l>Champagne problems</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>You told your family for a reason</l>
<l>You couldn't keep it in</l>
<l>Your sister splashed out on the bottle</l>
<l>Now no one's celebrating</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>Dom Pérignon, you brought it</l>
<l>No crowd of friends applauded</l>
<l>Your hometown skeptics called it</l>
<l>Champagne problems</l>
<l>You had a speech, you're speechless</l>
<l>Love slipped beyond your reaches</l>
<l>And I couldn't give a reason</l>
<l>Champagne problems</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>Your Midas touch on the Chevy door</l>
<l>November flush and your flannel cure</l>
<l>"This dorm was once a madhouse"</l>
<l>I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"</l>
<l>How evergreen, our group of friends</l>
<l>Don't think we'll say that word again</l>
<l>And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls</l>
<l>That we once walked through</l>
<l>One for the money, two for the show</l>
<l>I never was ready so I watch you go</l>
<l>Sometimes you just don't know the answer</l>
<l>'Til someone's on their knees and asks you</l>
<l>"She would've made such a lovely bride</l>
<l>What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said</l>
<l>But you'll find the real thing instead</l>
<l>She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And hold your hand while dancing</l>
<l>Never leave you standing</l>
<l>Crestfallen on the landing</l>
<l>With champagne problems</l>
<l>Your mom's ring in your pocket</l>
<l>Her picture in your wallet</l>
<l>You won't remember all my</l>
<l>Champagne problems</l>

<section type="outro">
<l>You won't remember all my</l>
<l>Champagne problems</l>
