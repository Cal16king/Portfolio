<l>Fatefully</l>
<l>I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me</l>
<l>Misery</l>
<l>Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep</l>
<l>And you passed right by</l>
<l>I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides</l>
<l>The knife cuts both ways</l>
<l>If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>And I fell from the pedestal</l>
<l>Right down the rabbit hole</l>
<l>Long story short, it was a bad time</l>
<l>Pushed from the precipice</l>
<l>Clung to the nearest lips</l>
<l>Long story short, it was the wrong guy</l>
</section>
<section type="post-chorus">
<l>Now I'm all about you</l>
<l>I'm all about you, ah</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah</l>
<l>I'm all about you, ah</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Actually</l>
<l>I always felt I must look better in the rear view</l>
<l>Missing me</l>
<l>At the golden gates they once held the keys to</l>
<l>When I dropped my sword</l>
<l>I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door</l>
<l>And we live in peace</l>
<l>But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>'Cause I fell from the pedestal</l>
<l>Right down the rabbit hole</l>

<l>No more keepin' score</l>
<l>Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)</l>
<l>No more tug of war</l>
<l>Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)</l>
<l>No more keepin' score</l>
<l>Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)</l>
<l>And my waves meet your shore</l>
<l>Ever and evermore</l>

<section type="verse" n="3">
<l>Past me</l>
<l>I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things</l>
<l>Your nemeses</l>
<l>Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing</l>
<l>And he's passing by</l>
<l>Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky</l>
<l>And he feels like home</l>
<l>If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go</l>

<l>And I fell from the pedestal</l>
<l>Right down the rabbit hole</l>

<l>Long story short, I survived</l>
