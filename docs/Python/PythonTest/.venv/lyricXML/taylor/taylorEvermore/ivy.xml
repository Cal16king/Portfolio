<l>How's one to know?</l>
<l>I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones</l>
<l>In a faith-forgotten land</l>
<l>In from the snow</l>
<l>Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow</l>
<l>Tarnished but so grand</l>

<section type="pre-chorus">
<l>And the old widow goes to the stone every day</l>
<l>But I don't, I just sit here and wait</l>
<l>Grieving for the living</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Oh, goddamn</l>
<l>My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand</l>
<l>Taking mine, but it's been promised to another</l>
<l>Oh, I can't</l>
<l>Stop you putting roots in my dreamland</l>
<l>My house of stone, your ivy grows</l>
<l>And now I'm covered in you</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>I wish to know</l>
<l>The fatal flaw that makes you long to be</l>
<l>Magnificently cursed</l>
<l>He's in the room</l>
<l>Your opal eyes are all I wish to see</l>
<l>He wants what's only yours</l>

<l>Oh, goddamn</l>

<l>Stop you putting roots in my dreamland</l>
<l>My house of stone, your ivy grows</l>
<l>And now I'm covered</l>

<l>Clover blooms in the fields</l>
<l>Spring breaks loose, the time is near</l>
<l>What would he do if he found us out?</l>
<l>Crescent moon, coast is clear</l>
<l>Spring breaks loose, but so does fear</l>
<l>He's gonna burn this house to the ground</l>
<l>How's one to know?</l>
<l>I'd live and die for moments that we stole</l>
<l>On begged and borrowed time</l>
<l>So tell me to run</l>
<l>Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become</l>
<l>And drink my husband's wine</l>

<l>So yeah, it's a fire</l>
<l>It's a goddamn blaze in the dark</l>
<l>And you started it</l>
<l>You started it</l>
<l>So yeah, it's a war</l>
<l>It's the goddamn fight of my life</l>
<l>And you started it</l>
<l>You started it</l>
