<l>Honey, when I'm above the trees</l>
<l>I see this for what it is</l>
<l>But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given</l>
<l>Is just shit we're dividin' up</l>
<l>Showed you all of my hiding spots</l>
<l>I was dancing when the music stopped</l>
<l>And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention</l>
<l>I haven't met the new me yet</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>There'll be happiness after you</l>
<l>But there was happiness because of you</l>
<l>Both of these things can be true</l>
<l>There is happiness</l>
</section>
<section type="post-chorus">
<l>Past the blood and bruise</l>
<l>Past the curses and cries</l>
<l>Beyond the terror in the nightfall</l>
<l>Haunted by the look in my eyes</l>
<l>That would've loved you for a lifetime</l>
<l>Leave it all behind</l>
<l>And there is happiness</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Tell me, when did your winning smile</l>
<l>Begin to look like a smirk?</l>
<l>When did all our lessons start to look like weapons</l>
<l>Pointed at my deepest hurt?</l>
<l>I hope she'll be a beautiful fool</l>
<l>Who takes my spot next to you</l>
<l>No, I didn't mean that</l>
<l>Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury</l>
<l>You haven't met the new me yet</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>There'll be happiness after me</l>
<l>But there was happiness because of me</l>
<l>Both of these things, I believe</l>
<l>There is happiness</l>

<section type="post-chorus">
<l>In our history, across our great divide</l>
<l>There is a glorious sunrise</l>
<l>Dappled with the flickers of light</l>
<l>From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind</l>
<l>And there is happiness</l>

<section type="bridge">
<l>I can't make it go away by making you a villain</l>
<l>I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven</l>
<l>And I pulled your body into mine</l>
<l>Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties</l>
<l>No one teaches you what to do</l>
<l>When a good man hurts you</l>
<l>And you know you hurt him too</l>

<l>Honey, when I'm above the trees</l>
<l>I see it for what it is</l>
<l>But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head</l>
<l>After giving you the best I had</l>
<l>Tell me what to give after that</l>
<l>All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness</l>
<l>You haven't met the new me yet</l>
<l>And I think she'll give you that</l>
