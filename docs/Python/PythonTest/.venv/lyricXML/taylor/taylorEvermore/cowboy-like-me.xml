<l>And the tennis court was covered up</l>
<l>With some tent-like thing</l>
<l>And you asked me to dance</l>
<l>But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"</l>
<l>Oh, I thought</l>
<l>This is gonna be one of those things</l>
<l>Now I know</l>
<l>I'm never gonna love again</l>

<section type="refrain">
<l>I've got some tricks up my sleeve</l>
<l>Takes one to know one</l>
<l>You're a cowboy like me</l>

<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Never wanted love</l>
<l>Just a fancy car</l>
<l>Now I'm waiting by the phone</l>
<l>Like I'm sitting in an airport bar</l>

<l>You had some tricks up your sleeve</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>Perched in the dark</l>
<l>Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear</l>
<l>Like it could be love</l>
<l>I could be the way forward</l>
<l>Only if they pay for it</l>
<l>You're a bandit like me</l>
<l>Eyes full of stars</l>
<l>Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here</l>
<l>It could be love</l>
<l>We could be the way forward</l>
<l>And I know I'll pay for it</l>

<l>And the skeletons in both our closets</l>
<l>Plotted hard to fuck this up</l>
<l>And the old men that I've swindled</l>
<l>Really did believe I was the one</l>
<l>And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about</l>
<l>When you passed through town</l>
<l>Oh, but that was all before I locked it down</l>

<section type="verse" n="3">
<l>Now you hang from my lips</l>
<l>Like the Gardens of Babylon</l>
<l>With your boots beneath my bed</l>
<l>Forever is the sweetest con</l>
