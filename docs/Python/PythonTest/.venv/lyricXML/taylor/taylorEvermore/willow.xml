<lyrics>
<section type="verse" n="1">
<l>I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night</l>
<l>Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife</l>
<l>And if it was an open-shut case</l>
<l>I never would've known from that look on your face</l>
<l>Lost in your current like a priceless wine</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>The more that you say, the less I know</l>
<l>Wherever you stray, I follow</l>
<l>I'm begging for you to take my hand</l>
<l>Wreck my plans, that's my man</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="2">
<l>Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind</l>
<l>Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in</l>
<l>As if you were a mythical thing</l>
<l>Like you were a trophy or a champion ring</l>
<l>And there was one prize I'd cheat to win</l>
</section>
<section type="chorus">
<l>The more that you say, the less I know</l>
<l>Wherever you stray, I follow</l>
<l>I'm begging for you to take my hand</l>
<l>Wreck my plans, that's my man</l>
<l>You know that my train could take you home</l>
<l>Anywhere else is hollow</l>
<l>I'm begging for you to take my hand</l>
<l>Wreck my plans, that's my man</l>
</section>
<section type="bridge">
<l>Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind</l>
<l>They count me out time and time again</l>
<l>Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind</l>
<l>But I come back stronger than a '90s trend</l>
</section>
<section type="verse" n="3">
<l>Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark</l>
<l>Show me the places where the others gave you scars</l>
<l>Now this is an open-shut case</l>
<l>I guess I should've known from the look on your face</l>
<l>Every bait-and-switch was a work of art</l>

<section type="chorus">
<l>The more that you say, the less I know</l>

<l>Hey, that's my man</l>
<l>That's my man</l>
<l>Yeah, that's my man</l>
<l>Every bait-and-switch was a work of art</l>
<l>That's my man</l>
<l>Hey, that's my man</l>
