    "# Networking popular words in lyrics\n",
    "For this exercise, we'll create a network of words (based on part of speech or some other classification) that are frequently used in collections of song lyrics assembled by the Olivia Rodriguez project team. For our network example, we ask: Which of the popular words is used the most frequently by particular artists? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're adapting this to your own project, take some time with your team to think about what's interesting to explore as a network from your project. You can use this cell to sketch out in markdown what you want to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to create this network are:\n",
    "## Collect the words, rank them, and select them\n",
    "* Collect the distinct words from all of the lyrics together by part of speech. (Let's look at nouns in this example.) Return these as a sorted list with duplicates removed, ranked from most to least frequent. \n",
    "* Streamline the list, by choosing, say, the top 10 or 20 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find out which artists use each word and how much\n",
    "* Reach into the collections assembled by artist.\n",
    "* For each word in our streamlined list, return a count of how much the artist repeats that word\n",
    "* Prepare network data (arranged as a TSV or pandas dataframe) with this structure. (The syntax will be different, but this is just an idea of the information we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "     word | used by | artist | count of times used by this artist\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative ways to develop networks of information\n",
    "There are lots of ways to think about how to explore word use in song lyrics. We are making something of a \"big picture\" study of the most popular words by part of speech used by all artists, and looking across their albums: a word is just used by an artist (regardless of which song or album it's in). But we could change this to take a closer look at other patterns. For example:\n",
    "* Change the context: word use by song or within an album!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a word of interest **to accept as input into the notebook** and:\n",
    "    * Look for all the ones most closely related in a collection using cosine similarity (see our early Python homework assignments to explore words similar to a word of interest).\n",
    "    * Try an adjacency network of words: Find out which other words of its type are sitting close (adjacent) to the word of interest. \n"

And I say I don\\'t care, I say that I\\'m fine But you know I can\\'t let it go, I\\'ve tried, I\\'ve tried, I\\'ve tried for so long It takes strength to forgive, but I don\\'t feel strong The arguments that I\\'ve won against you in my head In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed Yeah, I\\'m so tough when I\\'m alone, and I make you feel so guilty And I fantasize about a time you\\'re a little fuckin\\' sorry And I try to understand why you would do this all to me You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream How could anybody do the things you did so easily?

say that we\\'ll just screw it up in these trying times We\\'re not trying (Oh yeah, you\\'re right, I want it) So cut the headlights, summer\\'s a knife I\\'m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes And if I bleed, you\\'ll be the last to know, oh It\\'s new, the shape of your body It\\'s blue, the feeling I\\'ve got And it\\'s ooh, woah-oh

comin\\' home from the bar (Oh) Said, \"I\\'m fine,\" but it wasn\\'t true I don\\'t wanna keep secrets just to keep you And I snuck in through the garden gate Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh) And I scream, \"For whatever it\\'s worth I love you, ain\\'t that the worst thing you ever heard?\" He looks up, grinnin\\' like a devil It\\'s new, the shape of your body It\\'s blue, the

the cities I lived in Everyone looked worse in the light There are so many lines that I\\'ve crossed unforgiven I\\'ll tell you the truth but never goodbye I don\\'t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you I don\\'t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you I\\'ve been sleepin\\' so long in a twenty-year dark night And now I see daylight, I only see daylight Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky And so I became the butt of the joke I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked Clearin\\' the air, I breathed in the smoke Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down Maybe I\\'ve stormed out of every single room in this town Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it\\'s morning now It\\'s brighter now, now I don\\'t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you (I can never look away) I don\\'t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you (Things will never be the same) I\\'ve been sleepin\\' so long in a twenty-year dark night (Now I\\'m wide awake) And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight) I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight And I can still see it all (In my mind) All of you, all of me (Intertwined) I once believed love would be (Black and white) But it\\'s golden (Golden) And I can still see it all (In my head) Back and forth from New York (Sneakin\\' in your bed) I once believed love would be (Burnin\\' red) But it\\'s golden Like daylight, like daylight Like daylight, daylight I don\\'t wanna look at anything else now that I saw you (I can never look away) And I don\\'t wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you (Things will never be the same) I\\'ve been sleepin\\' so long in a twenty-year dark night (Now I\\'m wide

burning red) Like daylight It\\'s golden like daylight You gotta step into the daylight and let it go Just let it go, let it go I wanna be defined by the things that I love Not the things I hate Not the things I\\'m afraid of, I\\'m afraid of Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night I, I just think that You are what you love My, my, my, my My, my, my, my My, my, my, my My, my, my, my My, my, my, my My, my, my, my My, my, my, my My, my, my, my Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts Flashbacks waking me up I get drunk, but it\\'s not enough ’Cause the morning comes and you\\'re not my baby I look through the windows of this love Even though we boarded them up Chandelier\\'s still flickering here ’Cause I can\\'t pretend it\\'s okay when it\\'s not It\\'s death by a thousand cuts I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home I ask the traffic lights if it\\'ll be alright They say, \"I don\\'t know\" And what once was ours is no one\\'s now I see you everywhere, the only thing we share Is this small town You said it was a great love, one for the ages But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages? ’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts Flashbacks waking me up I get drunk, but it\\'s not enough ’Cause the morning comes and you\\'re not my baby I look through the windows of this love Even though we boarded them up Chandelier\\'s still flickering here \\'Cause I can’t pretend it\\'s okay when it\\'s not It\\'s death by a thousand cuts My heart, my hips, my body, my love Tryna find a part of me that you didn\\'t touch Gave up on me like I was a bad drug Now I\\'m searching for signs in a haunted club Our songs, our films, united we stand Our country, guess it was a lawless land Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust Tryna find a part of me you didn\\'t take up Gave you too much, but it wasn\\'t enough But I\\'ll be alright, it\\'s just a thousand cuts I get drunk, but it\\'s not enough \\'Cause you\\'re not my baby I look through the windows of this love Even though we boarded them up Chandelier\\'s still flickering here \\'Cause I can\\'t pretend it\\'s okay when it\\'s not No, it\\'s not It\\'s death by a thousand cuts (You didn\\'t touch) Tryna find a part of me that you didn\\'t touch My body, my love, my trust (It\\'s death by a thousand cuts) But it wasn\\'t enough, it wasn\\'t enough, no, no I take the long way home I ask the traffic lights if it\\'ll be alright They say, \"I don\\'t know\"
